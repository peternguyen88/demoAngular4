Half of the subjects in an experiment—the experimental group—consumed large quantities of a popular artificial sweetener. Afterward, this group showed lower cognitive abilities than did the other half of the subjects—the control group—who did not consume the sweetener. The detrimental effects were attributed to an amino acid that is one of the sweetener's principal constituents. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, would best support the conclusion that some ingredient of the sweetener was responsible for the experimental results?
(A) Most consumers of the sweetener do not consume as much of it as the experimental group members did.
(B) The amino acid referred to in the conclusion is a component of all proteins, some of which must be consumed for adequate nutrition.
(C) The quantity of the sweetener consumed by individuals in the experimental group is considered safe by federal food regulators.
(D) The two groups of subjects were evenly matched with regard to cognitive abilities prior to the experiment.
(E) A second experiment in which subjects consumed large quantities of the sweetener lacked a control group of subjects who were not given the sweetener.

The recent decline in the value of the dollar was triggered by a prediction of slower economic growth in the coming year. But that prediction would not have adversely affected the dollar had it not been for the government's huge budget deficit, which must therefore be decreased to prevent future currency declines.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the conclusion about how to prevent future currency declines?
(A) The government has made little attempt to reduce the budget deficit.
(B) The budget deficit has not caused a slowdown in economic growth.
(C) The value of the dollar declined several times in the year prior to the recent prediction of slower economic growth.
(D) Before there was a large budget deficit, predictions of slower economic growth frequently caused declines in the dollar's value.
(E) When there is a large budget deficit, other events in addition to predictions of slower economic growth sometimes trigger declines in currency value.

When three Everett-owned Lightning-built airplanes crashed in the same month, the Everett company ordered three new Lightning-built airplanes as replacements. This decision surprised many in the airline industry because, ordinarily when a product is involved in accidents, users become reluctant to buy that product. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the best indication that the Everett company's decision was logically well supported?
(A) Although during the previous year only one Lightning-built airplane crashed, competing manufacturers had a perfect safety record.
(B) The Lightning-built airplanes crashed due to pilot error, but because of the excellent quality of the planes there were many survivors.
(C) The Federal Aviation Association issued new guidelines for airlines in order to standardize safety requirements governing preflight inspections.
(D) Consumer advocates pressured two major airlines into purchasing safer airplanes so that the public would be safer while flying.
(E) Many Lightning Airplane Company employees had to be replaced because they found jobs with the competition.

The pharmaceutical industry argues that because new drugs will not be developed unless heavy development costs can be recouped in later sales, the current 20 years of protection provided by patents should be extended in the case of newly developed drugs. However, in other industries new-product development continues despite high development costs, a fact that indicates that the extension is unnecessary. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the pharmaceutical industry's argument against the challenge made above?
(A) No industries other than the pharmaceutical industry have asked for an extension of the 20-year limit on patent protection.
(B) Clinical trials of new drugs, which occur after the patent is granted and before the new drug can be marketed, often now take as long as 10 years to complete.
(C) There are several industries in which the ratio of research and development costs to revenues is higher than it is in the pharmaceutical industry.
(D) An existing patent for a drug does not legally prevent pharmaceutical companies from bringing to market alternative drugs, provided they are sufficiently dissimilar to the patented drug.
(E) Much recent industrial innovation has occurred in products—example, in the computer and electronics industries—which patent protection is often very ineffective.

Robot satellites relay important communications and identify weather patterns. Because the satellites can be repaired only in orbit, astronauts are needed to repair them. Without repairs, the satellites would eventually malfunction. Therefore, space flights carrying astronauts must continue. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most seriously weaken the argument above?
(A) Satellites falling from orbit because of malfunctions burn up in the atmosphere.
(B) Although satellites are indispensable in the identification of weather patterns, weather forecasters also make some use of computer projections to identify weather patterns.
(C) The government, responding to public pressure, has decided to cut the budget for space flights and put more money into social welfare programs.
(D) Repair of satellites requires heavy equipment, which adds to the amount of fuel needed to lift a spaceship carrying astronauts into orbit.
(E) Technical obsolescence of robot satellites makes repairing them more costly and less practical than sending new, improved satellites into orbit.

The proposal to hire ten new police officers in Middletown is quite foolish. There is sufficient funding to pay the salaries of the new officers, but not the salaries of additional court and prison employees to process the increased caseload of arrests and convictions that new officers usually generate. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, will most seriously weaken the conclusion drawn above?
(A) Studies have shown that an increase in a city's police force does not necessarily reduce crime.
(B) When one major city increased its police force by 19 percent last year, there were 40 percent more arrests and 13 percent more convictions.
(C) If funding for the new police officers' salaries is approved, support for other city services will have to be reduced during the next fiscal year.
(D) In most United States cities, not all arrests result in convictions, and not all convictions result in prison terms.
(E) Middletown's ratio of police officers to citizens has reached a level at which an increase in the number of officers will have a deterrent effect on crime.

The more frequently employees take time to exercise during working hours each week, the fewer sick days they take. Even employees who exercise only once a week during working hours take less sick time than those who do not exercise. Therefore, if companies started fitness programs, the absentee rate in those companies would decrease significantly. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above?
(A) Employees who exercise during working hours occasionally fall asleep for short periods of time after they exercise.
(B) Employees who are frequently absent are the least likely to cooperate with or to join a corporate fitness program.
(C) Employees who exercise only once a week in their company's fitness program usually also exercise after work.
(D) Employees who exercise in their company's fitness program use their working time no more productively than those who do not exercise.
(E) Employees who exercise during working hours take slightly longer lunch breaks than employees who do not exercise.

Recently a court ruled that current law allows companies to reject a job applicant if working in the job would entail a 90 percent chance that the applicant would suffer a heart attack. The presiding judge justified the ruling, saying that it protected both employees and employers. <br><br>The use of this court ruling as part of the law could not be effective in regulating employment practices if which of the following were true?
(A) The best interests of employers often conflict with the interests of employees.
(B) No legally accepted methods exist for calculating the risk of a job applicant's having a heart attack as a result of being employed in any particular occupation.
(C) Some jobs might involve health risks other than the risk of heart attack.
(D) Employees who have a 90 percent chance of suffering a heart attack may be unaware that their risk is so great.
(E) The number of people applying for jobs at a company might decline if the company, by screening applicants for risk of heart attack, seemed to suggest that the job entailed high risk of heart attack.

Treatment for hypertension forestalls certain medical expenses by preventing strokes and heart disease. Yet any money so saved amounts to only one-fourth of the expenditures required to treat the hypertensive population. Therefore, there is no economic justification for preventive treatment for hypertension. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, is most damaging to the conclusion above?
(A) The many fatal strokes and heart attacks resulting from untreated hypertension cause insignificant medical expenditures but large economic losses of other sorts.
(B) The cost, per patient, of preventive treatment for hypertension would remain constant even if such treatment were instituted on a large scale.
(C) In matters of health care, economic considerations should ideally not be dominant.
(D) Effective prevention presupposes early diagnosis, and programs to ensure early diagnosis are costly.
(E) The net savings in medical resources achieved by some preventive health measures are smaller than the net losses attributable to certain other measures of this kind.

Transnational cooperation among corporations is experiencing a modest renaissance among United States firms, even though projects undertaken by two or more corporations under a collaborative agreement are less profitable than projects undertaken by a single corporation. The advantage of transnational cooperation is that such joint international projects may allow United States firms to win foreign contracts that they would not otherwise be able to win. <br><br>Which of the following is information provided by the passage?
(A) Transnational cooperation involves projects too big for a single corporation to handle.
(B) Transnational cooperation results in a pooling of resources leading to high-quality performance.
(C) Transnational cooperation has in the past been both more common and less common than it is now among United States firms.
(D) Joint projects between United States and foreign corporations are not profitable enough to be worth undertaking.
(E) Joint projects between United States and foreign corporations benefit only those who commission the projects.

Until now, only injectable vaccines against influenza have been available. Parents are reluctant to subject children to the pain of injections, but adults, who are at risk of serious complications from influenza, are commonly vaccinated. A new influenza vaccine, administered painlessly in a nasal spray, is effective for children. However, since children seldom develop serious complications from influenza, no significant public health benefit would result from widespread vaccination of children using the nasal spray.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) Any person who has received the injectable vaccine can safely receive the nasal-spray vaccine as well.
(B) The new vaccine uses the same mechanism to ward off influenza as injectable vaccines do.
(C) The injectable vaccine is affordable for all adults.
(D) Adults do not contract influenza primarily from children who have influenza.
(E) The nasal spray vaccine is not effective when administered to adults.

Newspaper editorial: In an attempt to reduce the crime rate, the governor is getting tough on criminals and making prison conditions harsher. Part of this effort has been to deny inmates the access they formerly had to college-level courses. However, this action is clearly counter to the governor's ultimate goal, since after being released form prison, inmates who had taken such courses committed far fewer crimes overall than other inmates. <br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) Not being able to take college-level courses while in prison is unlikely to deter anyone from a crime that he or she might otherwise have committed.
(B) Former inmates are no more likely to commit crimes than are members of the general population.
(C) The group of inmates who chose to take college-level courses were not already less likely than other inmates to commit crimes after being released.
(D) Taking high school level courses in prison has less effect on an inmate's subsequent behavior than taking college-level courses does.
(E) The governor's ultimate goal actually is to gain popularity by convincing people that something effective is being done about crime.

A significant number of complex repair jobs carried out by Ace Repairs have to be reworked under the company's warranty. The reworked jobs are invariably satisfactory. When initial repairs are inadequate, therefore, it is not because the mechanics lack competence; rather, there is clearly a level of focused concentration that complex repairs require that is elicited more reliably by rework jobs than by first-time jobs. <br><br>The argument above assumes which of the following?
(A) There is no systematic difference in membership between the group of mechanics who do first-time jobs and the group of those who do rework jobs.
(B) There is no company that successfully competes with Ace Repairs for complex repair jobs.
(C) Ace Repairs' warranty is good on first-time jobs but does not cover rework jobs.
(D) Ace Repairs does not in any way penalize mechanics who have worked on complex repair jobs that later had to be reworked.
(E) There is no category of repair jobs in which Ace Repairs invariably carries out first-time jobs satisfactorily.

When storing Renaissance oil paintings, museums conform to standards that call for careful control of the surrounding temperature and humidity, with variations confined within narrow margins. Maintaining this environment is very costly, and recent research shows that even old oil paint is unaffected by wide fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Therefore, museums could relax their standards and save money without endangering their Renaissance oil paintings.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) Renaissance paintings were created in conditions involving far greater fluctuations in temperature and humidity than those permitted by current standards.
(B) Linder the current standards that museums use when storing Renaissance oil paintings, those paintings do not deteriorate at all.
(C) Museum collections typically do not contain items that are more likely to be vulnerable to fluctuations in temperature and humidity than Renaissance oil paintings.
(D) None of the materials in Renaissance oil paintings other than the paint are vulnerable enough to relatively wide fluctuations in temperature and humidity to cause damage to the paintings.
(E) Most Renaissance oil paintings are stored in museums located in regions near the regions where the paintings were created.

In the year following an eight-cent increase in the federal tax on a pack of cigarettes, sales of cigarettes fell ten percent. In contrast, in the year prior to the tax increase, sales had fallen one percent. The volume of cigarette sales is therefore strongly related to the after-tax price of a pack of cigarettes. <br><br>The argument above requires which of following assumptions?
(A) During the year following the tax increase, the pretax price of a pack of cigarettes did not increase by as much as it had during the year prior to the tax increase.
(B) The one percent fall in cigarette sales in the year prior to tax increase was due to a smaller tax increase.
(C) The pretax price of a pack of cigarettes gradually decreased throughout the year before and the year after the tax increase.
(D) For the year following the tax increase, the pretax price of a pack of cigarettes was not eight or more cents lower than it had been the previous year.
(E) As the after-tax price of a pack of cigarettes rises, the pretax price also rises.

In Kravonia, the average salary for jobs requiring a college degree has always been higher than the average salary for jobs that do not require a degree. Current enrollments in Kravonia's colleges indicate that over the next four years the percentage of the Kravonian workforce with college degrees will increase dramatically. Therefore, the average salary for all workers in Kravonia is likely to increase over the next four years.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) Kravonians with more than one college degree earn more, on average, than do Kravonians with only one college degree.
(B) The percentage of Kravonians who attend college in order to earn higher salaries is higher now than it was several years ago.
(C) The higher average salary for jobs requiring a college degree is not due largely to a scarcity among the Kravonian workforce of people with a college degree.
(D) The average salary in Kravonia for jobs that do not require a college degree will not increase over the next four years.
(E) Few members of the Kravonian workforce earned their degrees in other countries.

For most people, the left half of the brain controls linguistic capabilities, but some people have their language centers in the right half. When a language center of the brain is damaged, for example by a stroke, linguistic capabilities are impaired in some way. Therefore, people who have suffered a serious stroke on the left side of the brain without suffering any such impairment must have their language centers in the right half. <br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the reasoning in the argument above depends?
(A) No part of a person's brain that is damaged by a stroke ever recovers.
(B) Impairment of linguistic capabilities does not occur in people who have not suffered any damage to any language center of the brain.
(C) Strokes tend to impair linguistic capabilities more severely than does any other cause of damage to language centers in the brain.
(D) If there are language centers on the left side of the brain, any serious stroke affecting that side of the brain damages at least one of them.
(E) It is impossible to determine which side of the brain contains a person's language centers if the person has not suffered damage to either side of the brain.

In a certain wildlife park, park rangers are able to track the movements of many rhinoceroses because those animals wear radio collars. When, as often happens, a collar slips off, it is put back on. Putting a collar on a rhinoceros involves immobilizing the animal by shooting it with a tranquilizer dart. Female rhinoceroses that have been frequently recollared have significantly lower fertility rates than uncollared females. Probably, therefore, some substance in the tranquilizer inhibits fertility.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The dose of tranquilizer delivered by a tranquilizer dart is large enough to give the rangers putting collars on rhinoceroses a generous margin of safety.
(B) The fertility rate of uncollared female rhinoceroses in the park has been increasing in the past few decades.
(C) Any stress that female rhinoceroses may suffer as a result of being immobilized and handled has little or no negative effect on their fertility.
(D) The male rhinoceroses in the wildlife park do net lose their collars as often as the park's female rhinoceroses do.
(E) The tranquilizer used in immobilizing rhinoceroses is the same as the tranquilizer used in working with other large mammals.

In response to mounting public concern, an airplane manufacturer implemented a program with the well-publicized goal of reducing by half the total yearly amount of hazardous waste generated by its passenger-jet division. When the program began in 1994, the division's hazardous waste output was 90 pounds per production worker; last year it was 40 pounds per production worker. Clearly, therefore, charges that the manufacturer's program has not met its goal are false.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The amount of nonhazardous waste generated each year by the passenger-jet division has not increased significantly since 1994.
(B) At least as many passenger jets were produced by the division last year as had been produced in 1994.
(C) Since 1994, other divisions in the company have achieved reductions in hazardous waste output that are at least equal to that achieved in the passenger-jet division.
(D) The average number of weekly hours per production worker in the passenger-jet division was not significantly greater last year than it was in 1994.
(E) The number of production workers assigned to the passenger-jet division was not significantly less in 1994 than it was last year.

The milk of many mammals contains cannabinoids, substances that are known to stimulate certain receptors in the brain. To investigate the function of cannabinoids, researchers injected newborn mice with a chemical that is known to block cannabinoids from reaching their receptors in the brain. The injected mice showed far less interest in feeding than normal newborn mice do. Therefore, cannabinoids probably function to stimulate the appetite.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) Newborn mice do not normally ingest any substance other than their mothers' milk.
(B) Cannabinoids are the only substances in mammals' milk that stimulate the appetite.
(C) The mothers of newborn mice do not normally make any effort to encourage their babies to feed.
(D) The milk of mammals would be less nutritious if it did not contain cannabinoids.
(E) The chemical that blocks cannabinoids from stimulating their brain receptors does not independently inhibit the appetite.

Tourists have long complained that hotel accommodations in Midville are too expensive. Starting last year, the city council, hoping to attract more tourists, lowered the hotel tax rate to 5 percent of room charges. By the end of last year, Midville had taken in no less money from hotel taxes than it did the year before, so an examination of the hotel records will show that more tourists stayed in city hotels last year than the year before. <br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The tourists who stayed in Midville hotels last year were aware that the hotel tax rate had been lowered.
(B) The average price of hotel accommodations in Midville was not significantly higher than in hotels in other cities either last year or the year before.
(C) The average length of a tourist's stay in Midville hotels was not longer last year than it had been the year before.
(D) There were significantly more efforts to publicize Midville as a tourist destination last year than there had been the year before.
(E) On average, tourists in Midville did not spend significantly more on meals last year than they did on hotels accommodations.

Because it was long thought that few people would watch lengthy televised political messages, most televised political advertisements, like commercial advertisements, took the form of short messages. Last year, however, one candidate produced a half-hour-long advertisement. During the half hour the advertisement was aired, a substantial portion of the viewing public tuned into the advertisement. Clearly, then, many more people are interested in watching lengthy televised political messages than was previously thought.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The candidate's ratings improved significantly as a result of the half-hour-long political advertisement.
(B) Political advertisements have become increasingly influential in determining voters' decisions at the polls.
(C) Many people would appreciate the opportunity to become better acquainted with political candidates' views on current political issues.
(D) Most people who are interested in political issues watch television regularly.
(E) Most of the viewers who tuned in to the candidate's half-hour-long advertisement last year did not change channels after the first few minutes.

Because ethylene dibromide, a chemical used to fumigate grain, was blamed for the high rate of nerve damage suffered by people who work in grain-processing plants, many such plants switched to other chemical fumigants two years ago. Since then, however, the percentage of workers at these plants who were newly diagnosed with nerve damage has not dropped significantly. Therefore, either ethylene dibromide was wrongly blamed or else the new chemicals also cause nerve damage.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) If the new chemicals cause nerve damage, the nerve damage caused would be different from any nerve damage that ethylene dibromide may cause.
(B) There are no chemical fumigants that are completely safe for workers in grain-processing plants.
(C) If ethylene dibromide causes nerve damage, it does not take two years or longer for that damage to become detectable.
(D) Workers at grain-processing plants typically continue to work there even after being diagnosed with nerve damage.
(E) Workers at grain-processing plants that still use ethylene dibromide continue to have a high rate of nerve damage.

Lawmaker: Raising taxes is not the only means of reducing government debt. The government's stockpile of helium is worth 25 percent more, at current market prices, than the debt accumulated in acquiring and storing it. Therefore, by selling the helium, the government can not only pay off that debt but reduce its overall debt as well.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The government has no current need for helium.
(B) Twenty-five percent of the debt the government has accumulated in stockpiling helium is not an insignificant portion of the government's total debt.
(C) It is not in the lawmaker's interest to advocate raising taxes as a means of reducing government debt.
(D) Attempts to sell the government's helium will not depress the market price of helium by more than 25 percent.
(E) The government will not incur any costs in closing its facilities for stockpiling helium.

Early in the twentieth century, Lake Konfa became very polluted. Recently fish populations have recovered as release of industrial pollutants has declined and the lake's waters have become cleaner. Fears are now being voiced that the planned construction of an oil pipeline across the lake's bottom might revive pollution and cause the fish population to decline again. However, a technology for preventing leaks is being installed. Therefore, provided this technology is effective, those fears are groundless.<br><br>The argument depends on assuming which of the following?
(A) Apart from development related to the pipeline, there will be no new industrial development around the lake that will create renewed pollution in its waters.
(B) Other than the possibility of a leak, there is no realistic pollution threat posed to the lake by the pipeline's construction.
(C) There is no reason to believe that the leak-preventing technology would be ineffective when installed in the pipeline in Lake Konfa.
(D) Damage to the lake's fish populations would be the only harm that a leak of oil from the pipeline would cause.
(E) The species of fish that are present in Lake Konfa now are the same as those that were in the lake before it was affected by pollution.

In the past, every ten-percentage-point increase in cigarette prices in the country of Coponia has decreased per capita sales of cigarettes by four percent. Coponia is about to raise taxes on cigarettes by 9 cents per pack. The average price of cigarettes in Coponia is and has been for more than a year 90 cents per pack. So the tax hike stands an excellent chance of reducing per capita sales of cigarettes by four percent.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) Tobacco companies are unlikely to reduce their profit per pack of cigarettes to avoid an increase in the cost per pack to consumers in Coponia.
(B) Previous increases in cigarette prices in Coponia have generally been due to increases in taxes on cigarettes.
(C) Any decrease in per capita sales of cigarettes in Coponia will result mainly from an increase in the number of people who quit smoking entirely.
(D) At present, the price of a pack of cigarettes in Coponia includes taxes that amount to less than ten percent of the total selling price.
(E) The number of people in Coponia who smoke cigarettes has remained relatively constant for the past several years.

Personnel officer: The exorbitant cost of our health-insurance benefits reflects the high dollar amount of medical expenses incurred by our employees. Employees who are out of shape, as a group, have higher doctor bills and longer hospital stays than do their colleagues who are fit. Therefore, since we must reduce our health-insurance costs, we should offer a rigorous fitness program of jogging and weight lifting to all employees, and require employees who are out of shape to participate.<br><br>The conclusion reached by the personnel officer depends on which of the following assumptions?
(A) A person who is fit would receive a routine physical checkup by a doctor less regularly than would a person who is out of shape.
(B) The medical expenses incurred by employees who are required to participate in the fitness program would be less than those incurred by employees who are not required to participate.
(C) The strenuous activities required of out-of-shape employees by the program would not by themselves generate medical expenses greater than any reduction achieved by the program.
(D) The fitness program would serve more employees who are out of shape than it would employees who are fit.
(E) The employees who participate in the fitness program would be away from work because of illness less than would the employees who do not participate.

The ancient Nubians inhabited an area in which typhus occurred, yet surprisingly few of their skeletons show the usual evidence of this disease. The skeletons do show deposits of tetracycline, an antibiotic produced by a bacterium common in Nubian soil. This bacterium can flourish on the dried grain used for making two staples of the Nubian diet, beer and bread. Thus, tetracycline in their food probably explains the low incidence of typhus among ancient Nubians.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies?
(A) The tetracycline deposits did not form after the bodies were buried.
(B) The diseases other than typhus to which the ancient Nubians were exposed would not be affected by tetracycline.
(C) Typhus is generally fatal.
(D) Nubian grain became contaminated with tetracycline-producing bacteria prior to being harvested.
(E) Bread and beer were the only foods eaten by the ancient Nubians which could have contained tetracycline.

In Brindon County, virtually all of the fasteners—such as nuts, bolts, and screws—used by workshops and manufacturing firms have for several years been supplied by the Brindon Bolt Barn, a specialist wholesaler. In recent months many of Brindon County's workshops and manufacturing firms have closed down, and no new ones have opened. Therefore, the Brindon Bolt Barn will undoubtedly show a sharp decline in sales volume and revenue for this year as compared to last year.<br><br>The argument depends on assuming which of the following?
(A) Last year the Brindon Bolt Barn's sales volume and revenue were significantly higher than they had been the previous year.
(B) The workshops and manufacturing firms that have remained open have a smaller volume of work to do this year than they did last year.
(C) Soon the Brindon Bolt Barn will no longer be the only significant supplier of fasteners to Brindon County's workshops.
(D) The Brindon Bolt Barn's operating expenses have not increased this year.

Educational Theorist: Recent editorials have called for limits on the amount of homework assigned to children. They point out that free-time activities play an important role in childhood development and that large amounts of homework reduce children's free time, hindering their development. But the average homework time for a ten year old, for example, is little more than 30 minutes per night. Clearly, therefore, there is no need to impose the limits these editorials are calling for.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the educational theorist's argument relies?
(A) The free-time activities that ten year olds engage in most are all approximately equally effective at fostering development
(B) Regularly doing homework assignments improves children's academic performance.
(C) Individual teachers are not the best judges of how much homework to assign the children they teach
(D) In most schools, if not all, the homework assignments given are of a length that does not diverge widely from the average.
(E) Free-time activities rarely teach children skills or information that they can use in their academic work.

Political advocacy groups have begun to use information services to disseminate information that is then accessed by the public via personal computer. Since many groups are thus able to bypass traditional news sources, whose reporting is selective, and to present their political views directly to the public, information services present a more balanced picture of the complexities of political issues than any traditional news source presents.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument above depends?
(A) Information services are accessible to enough people to ensure that political advocacy groups can use these services to reach as large a percentage of the public as they could through traditional news sources.
(B) People could get a thorough understanding of a particular political issue by sorting through information provided by several traditional news sources, each with differing editorial biases.
(C) Information on political issues disseminated through information services does not come almost entirely from advocacy groups that share a single bias.
(D) Traditional news sources seldom report the views of political advocacy groups accurately.
(E) Most people who get information on political issues from newspapers and other traditional news sources can readily identify the editorial biases of those sources.

Excavations of the Roman city of Sepphoris have uncovered numerous detailed mosaics depicting several readily identifiable animal species: a hare, a partridge, and various Mediterranean fish. Oddly, most of the species represented did not live in the Sepphoris region when these mosaics were created. Since identical motifs appear in mosaics found in other Roman cities, however, the mosaics of Sepphoris were very likely created by traveling artisans from some other part of the Roman Empire.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?

City Official: At City Hospital, uninsured patients tend to have shorter stays and fewer procedures performed than do insured patients, even though insured patients, on average, have slightly less serious medical problems at the time of admission to the hospital than uninsured patients have. Critics of the hospital have concluded that <strong>the uninsured patients are mot receiving proper medical care.</strong> However, <strong>this conclusion is almost certainly false.</strong> Careful investigation has recently shown two things: insured patients have much longer stays in the hospital than necessary, and they tend to have more procedures performed than are medically necessary. <br><br>In the city official's argument, the two boldface portions play which of the following roles?

<strong>Environmental organizations want to preserve the land surrounding the Wilgrinn Wilderness Area from residential development.</strong> They plan to do this by purchasing that land from the farmers who own it. That plan is ill-conceived: if the farmers did sell their land, they would sell it to the highest bidder, and developers would outbid any other bidders. On the other hand, <strong>these farmers will never actually sell any of the land, provided that farming it remains viable.</strong> But farming will not remain viable if the farms are left unmodernized, and most of the farmers lack the financial resources modernization requires. And that is exactly why a more sensible preservation strategy would be to assist the farmers to modernize their farms to the extent needed to maintain viability. <br><br>In the argument as a whole, the two boldface proportions play which of the following roles?
(A) The first presents a goal that the argument rejects as ill-conceived; the second is evidence that is presented as grounds for that rejection.

Scientists typically do their most creative work before the age of forty. It is commonly thought that this happens because <strong>aging by itself brings about a loss of creative capacity.</strong> However, studies show that <strong>a disproportionately large number of the scientists who produce highly creative work beyond the age of forty entered their field at an older age than is usual.</strong> Since by the age of forty the large majority of scientists have been working in their field for at least fifteen years, the studies' finding strongly suggests that the real reason why scientists over forty rarely produce highly creative work is not that they have simply aged but rather that they generally have spent too long in a given field. <br><br>In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?

Criminologist: Some legislators advocate mandating a sentence of life in prison for anyone who, having twice served sentences for serious crimes, is subsequently convicted of a third serious crime. These legislators argue that <strong>such a policy would reduce crime dramatically,</strong> since it would take people with a proven tendency to commit crimes off the streets permanently. What this reasoning overlooks, however, is that people old enough to have served two prison sentences for serious crimes rarely commit more than one subsequent crime. <strong>Filling our prisons with such individuals would have exactly the opposite of the desired effect,</strong> since it would limit our ability to incarcerate younger criminals, who commit a far greater proportion of serious crimes.<br><br>In the argument as a whole, the two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles?

Though sucking zinc lozenges has been promoted as a treatment for the common cold, research has revealed no consistent effect. Recently, however, a zinc gel applied nasally has been shown to greatly reduce the duration of colds. Since the gel contains zinc in the same form and concentration as the lozenges, the greater effectiveness of the gel must be due to the fact that cold viruses tend to concentrate in the nose, not the mouth. <br><br>In order to evaluate the argument, it would be most helpful to determine which of the following?
(A) Whether zinc is effective only against colds, or also has an effect on other virally caused diseases
(B) Whether there are remedies that do not contain zinc but that, when taken orally, can reduce the duration of colds
(C) Whether people who frequently catch colds have a zinc deficiency
(D) Whether either the zinc gel or the lozenges contain ingredients that have an impact on the activity of the zinc
(E) Whether the zinc gel has an effect on the severity of cold symptoms, as well as on their duration

Following several years of declining advertising sales, the Greenville Times reorganized its advertising sales force two years ago. Before the reorganization, the sales force was organized geographically, with some sales representatives concentrating on city-center businesses and others concentrating on different outlying regions. The reorganization attempted to increase the sales representatives' knowledge of clients' businesses by having each sales representative deal with only one type of industry or of retailing. After the reorganization, advertising sales increased. <br><br>In assessing whether the improvement in advertising sales can properly be attributed to the reorganization, it would be helpful to find out each of the following EXCEPT:
(A) Two years ago, what proportion of the Greenville Times' total revenue was generated by advertising sales?
(B) Has the circulation of the Greenville Times increased substantially in the last two years?
(C) Has there been a substantial turnover in personnel in the advertising sales force over the last two years?
(D) Before the reorganization, had sales representatives found it difficult to keep up with relevant developments in all types of businesses to which they are assigned?
(E) Has the economy in Greenville and the surrounding regions been growing rapidly over the last two years?

Fedora Convertibles began selling the Freewheeler - its newest convertible sports car - in May of this year. Fedora sent out a press release last month indicating that the Freewheeler's sales for May, June, July, and August totaled over 50,000. As a result, Fedora will in all likelihood easily meet its stated sales goal of 120,000 for Freewheeler's first year of release.<br><br>Which of the following would be most useful in order to evaluate this prediction?
(A) Fedora is the market leader in this category of automobile.

Proposal: Carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere block the escape of heat into space. So emission of these "greenhouse" gases contributes to global warming. In order to reduce global warming, emission of greenhouse gases needs to be reduced. Therefore, the methane now emitted from open landfills should instead be burned to produce electricity. Objection: The burning of methane generates carbon dioxide that is released into the atmosphere.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most adequately counters the objection made to the proposal?
(A) Every time a human being or other mammal exhales, there is some carbon dioxide released into the air.
(B) The conversion of methane to electricity would occur at a considerable distance from the landfills.
(C) The methane that is used to generate electricity would generally be used as a substitute for a fuel that does not produce any greenhouse gases when burned.
(D) Methane in the atmosphere is more effective in blocking the escape of heat from the Earth than is carbon dioxide.

It is theoretically possible that bacteria developed on Mars early in its history and that some were carried to Earth by a meteorite. However, strains of bacteria from different planets would probably have substantial differences in protein structure that would persist over time, and no two bacterial strains on Earth are different enough to have arisen on different planets. So, even if bacteria did arrive on Earth from Mars, they must have died out. <br><br>The argument is most vulnerable to which of the following criticisms?
(A) It fails to establish whether bacteria actually developed on Mars.
(B) It fails to establish how likely it is that Martian bacteria were transported to Earth.
(C) It fails to consider whether there were means other than meteorites by which Martian bacteria could have been carried to Earth.
(D) It fails to consider whether all bacteria now on Earth could have arisen from transported Martian bacteria.

Unless tiger hunting decreases, tigers will soon be extinct in the wild. The countries in which the tigers' habitats are located are currently debating joint legislation that would ban tiger hunting. Thus, if these countries can successfully enforce this legislation, the survival of tigers in the wild will be ensured. <br><br>The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument
(A) assumes without sufficient warrant that a ban on tiger hunting could be successfully enforced
(B) considers the effects of hunting on tigers without also considering the effects of hunting on other endangered animal species
(C) fails to take into account how often tiger hunters are unsuccessful in their attempts to kill tigers

Yeasts capable of leavening bread are widespread, and in the many centuries during which the ancient Egyptians made only unleavened bread, such yeasts must frequently have been mixed into bread doughs accidentally. The Egyptians, however, did not discover leavened bread until about 3000 B.C. That discovery roughly coincided with the introduction of a wheat variety that was preferable to previous varieties because its edible kernel could be removed from the husk without first toasting the grain.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest evidence that the two developments were causally related?
(A) Even after the ancient Egyptians discovered leavened bread and the techniques for reliably producing it were well known, unleavened bread continued to be widely consumed.
(B) Only when the Egyptians stopped the practice of toasting grain were their stonelined grain- toasting pits available for baking bread.
(C) Heating a wheat kernel destroys its gluten, a protein that must be present in order for yeast to leaven bread dough.
(D) The new variety of wheat, which had a more delicate flavor because it was not toasted, was reserved for the consumption of high officials when it first began to be grown.
(E) Because the husk of the new variety of wheat was more easily removed, flour made from it required less effort to produce.

A theory is either true or false. Galileo's observations of Jupiter's satellites showed that the Ptolemaic theory of the motion of celestial bodies is false.

The legislature's move to raise the salary has done nothing to improve the situation, because it was coupled with a ban on receiving money for lectures and teaching engagements. Pat: No, the raise in salary really does improve the situation. Since very few judges teach or give lectures, the ban will have little or no negative effect.<br><br>Pat's response to Mel is inadequate in that it

Which of the following most logically completes the argument?<br><br>When people engage in activities that help others, their brain releases endorphins, the brain's natural opiates, which induce in people a feeling of well-being. It has been suggested that regular release of endorphins increases people's longevity. And a statistic on adults who regularly engage in volunteer work helping others shows that they live longer, on average, than adults who do not volunteer. However, that statistic would be what we would expect even if volunteering does not boost longevity, because.
(A) in the communities studied, women were much more likely to do regular volunteer work than men were, and women tend to live longer than men do.
(B) the number of young adults who do regular volunteer work is on the increase
(C) the feelings of well-being induced by endorphins can, at least for a time, mask the symptoms of various conditions and diseases, provided the symptoms are mild.

Smithtown University's fund-raisers succeeded in getting donations from 80 percent of the potential donors they contacted. This success rate, exceptionally high for university fund¬raisers, does not indicate that they were doing a good job.

The high success rate shows insufficient canvassing effort. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides more support for the argument?
(A) Smithtown University's fund-raisers were successful in their contacts with potential donors who had never given before about as frequently as were fund-raisers for other universities in their contacts with such people.

Manatees, aquatic mammals inhabiting Florida's rivers and coastal waters, swim close to the surface and are frequently killed in collisions with boats. To address the problem, boat traffic in manatee-populated waters is being required to maintain very low speeds. Unfortunately, manatees are unable to hear low-pitched sounds and a boat's sound lowers in pitch as the boat slows. Therefore, this approach may in fact make things worse rather than better. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, casts most doubt on the conclusion?
(A) The areas where boats would have to maintain low speeds were decided partly on the basis of manatee-population estimates and partly from numbers of reported collisions between manatees and boats.
(B) Because the water hyacinth that manatees feed on grows best in water that is nearly still, water hyacinth beds can be disturbed or damaged by fast-moving boat traffic.
(C) Over the last several decades, boat traffic in Florida's coastal waters has been increasing almost continuously and now represents the greatest threat to the endangered manatee population.
