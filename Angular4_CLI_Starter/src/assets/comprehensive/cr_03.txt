That the application of new technology can increase the productivity of existing coal mines is demonstrated by the case of Tribnia's coal industry. Coal output per miner in Tribnia is double what it was five years ago, even though no new mines have opened. <br><br>Which of the following can be properly concluded from the statement about coal output per miner in the passage?
(A) If the number of miners working in Tribnian coal mines has remained constant in the past five years, Tribnia's total coal production has doubled in that period of time.
(B) Any individual Tribnian coal mine that achieved an increase in overall output in the past five years has also experienced an increase in output per miner.
(C) If any new coal mines had opened in Tribnia in the past five years, then the increase in output per miner would have been even greater than it actually was.
(D) If any individual Tribnian coal mine has not increased its output per miner in the past five years, then that mine's overall output has declined or remained constant.
(E) In Tribnia the cost of producing a given quantity of coal has declined over the past five years.

The quality of unrefined olive oil is not actually defined in terms of acidity, yet extensive tests have shown that the less free oleic acid an unrefined olive oil contains per liter, the higher its quality. The proportion of free oleic acid that an olive oil contains is an accurate measure of the oil's acidity. <br><br>If the statements above are all true, which of the following conclusions is best supported by them?
(A) When an olive oil is refined, the concentration of oleic acid in the oil is reduced.
(B) The quality of an unrefined olive oil can be determined only by accurately measuring its acidity.
(C) If an unrefined olive oil is intermediate in acidity between two other unrefined olive oils, it will also be intermediate between them in quality.
(D) Free oleic acid is the only acid that unrefined olive oil contains.
(E) People who judge the quality of unrefined olive oils actually judge those oils by their acidity, which the judges can taste.

Sunflowers growing in pots were placed, with their roots submerged, in the pond contaminated with radioactive elements. The sunflowers kept growing; in the process, they absorbed radioactive elements. Within twelve days, 85 percent of the radioactive elements were removed from the water, which is no less than can be accomplished with the much more expensive conventional filtration techniques. Scientists therefore propose using sunflowers for decontamination wherever there are radioactively contaminated ponds. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, points to a limitation on the applicability of the proposed method of decontamination?
(A) Some plants other than sunflowers can also remove radioactive elements from water.
(B) The water in many ponds contaminated with radioactive elements is so cold that it would kill sunflowers whose roots were submerged in it.
(C) Sunflowers that grow with their roots submerged in water grow less well than sunflowers growing under optimal conditions on dry land.
(D) Only species of sunflowers with large leaves can have their roots submerged in water and still keep growing.
(E) In ponds in which the circulation of the water is artificially increased, sunflowers absorb radioactive elements far faster than they do in other ponds.

Which of the following most logically completes the passage?<br><br>Concerned about financial well-being of its elderly citizens, the government of Runagia decided two years ago to increase by 20 percent the government-provided pension paid to all Runagians over 65. Inflation in the intervening period has been negligible, and the increase has been duly received by all eligible Runagians. Nevertheless, many of them are no better off financially than they were before the increase, in large part because
(A) They rely entirely on the government pension for their income
(B) Runagian banks are so inefficient that it can take up to three weeks to cash a pension check
(C) They buy goods whose prices tend to rise especially fast in times of inflation
(D) The pension was increased when the number of elderly Runagians below the poverty level reached an all-time high
(E) In Runagia children typically supplement the income of elderly parents, but only by enough to provide them with a comfortable living

Brochure: Help conserve our city's water supply. By converting the landscaping in your yard to a water-conserving landscape, you can greatly reduce your outdoor water use. A water-conserving landscape is natural and attractive, and it also saves you money.<br><br>Criticism: For most people with yards, the savings from converting to a water-conserving landscape cannot justify the expense of new landscaping, since typically the conversion would save less than twenty dollars on a homeowner's yearly water bills.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the best basis for a rebuttal of the criticism?
(A) Even homeowners whose yards do not have water-conserving landscapes can conserve water by installing water-saving devices in their homes.
(B) A conventional landscape generally requires a much greater expenditure on fertilizer and herbicide than does a water-conserving landscape.
(C) A significant proportion of the residents of the city live in buildings that do not have yards.
(D) It costs no more to put in water-conserving landscaping than it does to put in conventional landscaping.
(E) Some homeowners use more water to maintain their yards than they use for all other purposes combined.

Shipping Clerk: The five specially ordered shipments sent out last week were sent out on Thursday. Last week, all of the shipments that were sent out on Friday consisted entirely of building supplies, and the shipping department then closed for the weekend. Four shipments were sent to Truax Construction last week, only three of which consisted of building supplies. <br><br>If the shipping clerk's statements are true, which of the following must also be true?
(A) At least one of the shipments sent to Truax Construction last week was specially ordered.
(B) At least one of last week's specially ordered shipments did not consist of building supplies.
(C) At least one of the shipments sent to Truax Construction was not sent out on Thursday of last week.
(D) At least one of the shipments that were sent out on Friday of last week was sent to Truax Construction.
(E) At least one of the shipments sent to Truax Construction last week was sent out before Friday.

Although most smoking-related illnesses are caused by inhaling the tar in tobacco smoke, it is addiction to nicotine that prevents most smokers from quitting. In an effort to decrease the incidence of smoking-related illnesses, lawmakers in Sandonia plan to reduce the average quantity of nicotine per cigarette by half over the next five years. Unfortunately, smokers who are already addicted to nicotine tend to react to such reductions by smoking correspondingly more cigarettes. <br><br>The information above most strongly supports which of the following predictions about the effects of implementing the Sandonian government's plan?
(A) The average quantity of tar inhaled by Sandonian smokers who are currently addicted to nicotine will probably not decrease during the next five years.
(B) Sandonian smokers who are not already addicted to nicotine will probably also begin to smoke more cigarettes during the next five years than they had previously.
(C) The annual number of Sandonian smokers developing smoking-related illnesses will probably decrease during the next five years.
(D) The proportion of Sandonians attempting to quit smoking who succeed in that attempt will probably decrease during the next five years.
(E) The number of Sandonians who quit smoking during the next five years will probably exceed the number who quit during the last five years.

Kate: The recent decline in numbers of the Tennessee warbler, a North American songbird that migrates each fall to coffee plantations in South America, is due to the elimination of the dense tree cover that formerly was a feature of most South American coffee plantations.<br><br>Scott: The population of the spruce budworm, the warbler's favorite prey in North America, has been dropping. This is a more likely explanation of the warbler's decline.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls Scott's hypothesis into question?
(A) The numbers of the Baltimore oriole, a songbird that does not eat budworms but is as dependent on South American coffee plantations as is the Tennessee warbler, are declining.
(B) The spruce-budworm population has dropped because of a disease that can infect budworms but not Tennessee warblers.
(C) The drop in the population of the spruce budworm is expected to be only temporary.
(D) Many Tennessee warbler have begun migrating in the fall to places other than traditional coffee plantations.
(E) Although many North American songbirds have declined in numbers, no other species has experienced as great a decline as has the Tennessee warbler.

From 1980 to 1989, total consumption of fish in the country of Jurania increased by 4.5 percent, and total consumption of poultry products there increased by 9.0 percent. During the same period, the population of Jurania increased by 6 percent, in part due to immigration to Jurania from other countries in the region.<br><br>If the statements above are true, which of the following must also be true on the basis of them?
(A) During the 1980's in Jurania, profits of wholesale distributors of poultry products increased at a greater rate than did profits of wholesale distributors of fish.
(B) For people who immigrated to Jurania during the 1980's, fish was less likely to be a major part of their diet than was poultry.
(C) In 1989 Juranians consumed twice as much poultry as fish.
(D) For a significant proportion of Jurania's population, both fish and poultry products were a regular part of their diet during the 1980's.
(E) Per capita consumption of fish in Jurania was lower in 1989 than in 1980.

When a new restaurant, Martin's Cafe, opened in Riverville last year, many people predicted that business at the Wildflower Inn, Riverville's only other restaurant, would suffer from the competition. Surprisingly, however, in the year since Martin's Cafe opened, the average number of meals per night served at the Wildflower Inn has increased significantly. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the increase?
(A) Unlike the Wildflower Inn, Martin's Cafe serves considerably more meals on weekends than it does on weekdays.
(B) Most of the customers of Martin's Cafe had never dined in Riverville before this restaurant opened, and on most days Martin's Cafe attracts more customers than it can seat.
(C) The profit per meal is higher, on average, for meals served at Martin's Cafe than for those served at the Wildflower Inn.
(D) The Wildflower Inn is not open on Sundays, and therefore Riverville residents who choose to dine out on that day must either eat at Martin's Cafe or go to neighboring towns to eat.
(E) A significant proportion of the staff at Martin's Cafe are people who formerly worked at the Wildflower Inn and were hired away by the owner of Martin's Cafe.

Lightbox, Inc., owns almost all of the movie theaters in Washington County and has announced plans to double the number of movie screens it has in the county within five years. Yet attendance at Lightbox's theaters is only just large enough for profitability now and the county's population is not expected to increase over the next ten years. Clearly, therefore, if there is indeed no increase in population, Lightbox's new screens are unlikely to prove profitable. <br><br>Which of the following, if true about Washington County, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) Though little change in the size of the population is expected, a pronounced shift toward a younger, more affluent, and more entertainment-oriented population is expected to occur.
(B) The sales of snacks and drinks in its movie theaters account for more of Lightbox's profits than ticket sales do.
(C) In selecting the mix of movies shown at its theaters, Lightbox's policy is to avoid those that appeal to only a small segment of the moviegoing population.
(D) Spending on video purchases, as well as spending on video rentals, is currently no longer increasing.
(E) There are no population centers in the county that are not already served by at least one of the movie theaters that Lightbox owns and operates.

Healthy lungs produce a natural antibiotic that protects them from infection by routinely killing harmful bacteria on airway surfaces. People with cystic fibrosis, however, are unable to fight off such bacteria, even though their lungs produce normal amounts of the antibiotic. The fluid on airway surfaces in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis has an abnormally high salt concentration; accordingly, scientists hypothesize that the high salt concentration is what makes the antibiotic ineffective. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the scientists' hypothesis?
(A) When the salt concentration of the fluid on the airway surfaces of healthy people is raised artificially, the salt concentration soon returns to normal.
(B) A sample of the antibiotic was capable of killing bacteria in an environment with an unusually low concentration of salt.
(C) When lung tissue from people with cystic fibrosis is maintained in a solution with a normal salt concentration, the tissue can resist bacteria.
(D) Many lung infections can be treated by applying synthetic antibiotics to the airway surfaces.
(E) High salt concentrations have an antibiotic effect in many circumstances.

Wind farms, which generate electricity using arrays of thousands of wind-powered turbines, require vast expanses of open land. County X and County Y have similar terrain, but the population density of County X is significantly higher than that of County Y. Therefore, a wind farm proposed for one of the two counties should be built in County Y rather than in County X. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the planner's argument?
(A) County X and County Y are adjacent to each other, and both are located in the windiest area of the state.
(B) The total population of County Y is substantially greater than that of County X.
(C) Some of the electricity generated by wind farms in County Y would be purchased by users outside the county.
(D) Wind farms require more land per unit of electricity generated than does any other type of electrical-generation facility.
(E) Nearly all of County X's population is concentrated in a small part of the county, while County Y's population is spread evenly throughout the country.

Over the past five years, the price gap between name-brand cereals and less expensive store-brand cereals has become so wide that consumers have been switching increasingly to store brands despite the name brands' reputation for better quality. To attract these consumers back, several manufacturers of name-brand cereals plan to narrow the price gap between their cereals and store brands to less than what it was five years ago. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously calls into question the likelihood that the manufacturers' plan will succeed in attracting back a large percentage of consumers who have switched to store brands?
(A) There is no significant difference among manufacturers of name-brand cereals in the prices they charge for their products.
(B) Consumers who have switched to store-brand cereals have generally been satisfied with the quality of those cereals.
(C) Many consumers would never think of switching to store-brand cereals because they believe the name brand cereals to be of better quality.
(D) Because of lower advertising costs, stores are able to offer their own brands of cereals at significantly lower prices than those charged for name-brand cereals.
(E) Total annual sales of cereals—including both name-brand and store-brand cereals—have not increased significantly over the past five years.

Wolves generally avoid human settlements. For this reason, domestic sheep, though essentially easy prey for wolves, are not usually attacked by them. In Hylantia prior to 1910, farmers nevertheless lost considerable numbers of sheep to wolves each year. Attributing this to the large number for wolves, in 1910 the government began offering rewards to hunters for killing wolves. From 1910 to 1915, large numbers of wolves were killed. Yet wolf attacks on sheep increased significantly. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the increase in wolf attacks on sheep?
(A) Populations of deer and other wild animals that wolves typically prey on increased significantly in numbers from 1910 to 1915.
(B) Prior to 1910, there were no legal restrictions in Hylantia on the hunting of wolves.
(C) After 1910 hunters shot and wounded a substantial number of wolves, thereby greatly diminishing these wolves' ability to prey on wild animals.
(D) Domestic sheep are significantly less able than most wild animals to defend themselves against wolf attacks.
(E) The systematic hunting of wolves encouraged by the program drove many wolves in Hylantia to migrate to remote mountain areas uninhabited by humans.

Nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant emitted by automobiles. Catalytic converters, devices designed to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions, have been required in all new cars in Donia since 1993, and as a result, nitrogen dioxide emissions have been significantly reduced throughout most of the country. Yet although the proportion of new cars in Donia's capital city has always been comparatively high, nitrogen dioxide emissions there have showed only an insignificant decline since 1993. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the insignificant decline in nitrogen dioxide emissions in Donia's capital city?
(A) More of the cars in Donia's capital city were made before 1993 than after 1993.
(B) The number of new cars sold per year in Donia has declined slightly since 1993.
(C) Pollutants other than nitrogen dioxide that are emitted by automobiles have also been significantly reduced in Donia since 1993.
(D) Many Donians who own cars made before 1993 have had catalytic converters installed in their cars.
(E) Most car trips in Donia's capital city are too short for the catalytic converter to reach its effective working temperature.

Capuchin monkeys often rub their bodies with a certain type of millipede. Laboratory tests show that secretions from the bodies of these millipedes are rich in two chemicals that are potent mosquito repellents, and mosquitoes carry parasites that debilitate capuchins. Some scientists hypothesize that the monkeys rub their bodies with the millipedes because doing so helps protect them from mosquitoes. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the most support for the scientists' hypothesis?
(A) A single millipede often gets passed around among several capuchins, all of whom rub their bodies with it.
(B) The two chemicals that repel mosquitoes also repel several other varieties of insects.
(C) The capuchins rarely rub their bodies with the millipedes except during the rainy season, when mosquito populations are at their peak.
(D) Although the capuchins eat several species of insects, they do not eat the type of millipede they use to rub their bodies.
(E) The two insect-repelling chemicals in the secretions of the millipedes are carcinogenic for humans but do not appear to be carcinogenic for capuchins.

Five years ago, as part of a plan to encourage citizens of Levaska to increase the amount of money they put into savings, Levaska's government introduced special savings accounts in which up to $3,000 a year can be saved with no tax due on the interest unless money is withdrawn before the account holder reaches the age of sixty-five. Millions of dollars have accumulated in the special accounts, so the government's plan is obviously working. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) A substantial number of Levaskans have withdrawn at least some of the money they had invested in the special accounts.
(B) Workers in Levaska who already save money in long-term tax-free accounts that are offered through their workplace cannot take advantage of the special savings accounts introduced by the government.
(C) The rate at which interest earned on money deposited in regular savings accounts is taxed depends on the income bracket of the account holder.
(D) Many Levaskans who already had long-term savings have steadily been transferring those savings into the special accounts.
(E) Many of the economists who now claim that the government's plan has been successful criticized it when it was introduced.

Which of the following most logically completes the argument below?<br><br>According to promotional material published by the city of Springfield, more tourists stay in hotels in Springfield than stay in the neighboring city of Harristown. A brochure from the largest hotel in Harristown claims that more tourists stay in that hotel than stay in the Royal Arms Hotel in Springfield. If both of these sources are accurate, however, the county's "Report on Tourism" must be in error in indicating that.
(A) more tourists stay in hotel accommodations in Harristown than stay in the Royal Arms Hotel
(B) the Royal Arms Hotel is the only hotel in Springfield
(C) there are several hotels in Harristown that are larger than the Royal Arms Hotel
(D) some of the tourists who have stayed in hotels in Harristown have also stayed in the Royal Arms Hotel

Of patients over 65 years old who survived coronary bypass surgery—a procedure widely prescribed for people with heart disease—only 75 percent benefited from the surgery. Thus it appears that for one in four such patients, the doctors who advised them to undergo this surgery, with its attendant risks and expense, were more interested in an opportunity to practice their skills and in their fee than in helping the patient.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
(A) Many of the patients who receive coronary bypass surgery are less than 55 years old.
(B) Possible benefits of coronary bypass surgery include both relief from troubling symptoms and prolongation of life.
(C) Most of the patients in the survey decided to undergo coronary bypass surgery because they were advised that the surgery would reduce their risk of future heart attacks.
(D) The patients over 65 years old who did not benefit from the coronary bypass surgery were as fully informed as those who did benefit from the surgery as to the risks of the surgery prior to undergoing it.
(E) The patients who underwent coronary bypass surgery but who did not benefit from it were medically indistinguishable, prior to their surgery, from the patients who did benefit.

Escalating worldwide demand for corn has led to a sharp increase in the market price of corn, and corn prices are likely to remain high. Corn is extensively used as feed for livestock, and because profit margins are tight in the livestock business, many farmers are expected to leave the business. With fewer suppliers, meat prices will surely rise. Nonetheless, observers expect an immediate short-term decrease in meat prices. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to justify the observers' expectation?
(A) The increase in corn prices is due more to a decline in the supply of corn than to a growth in demand for it.
(B) Generally, farmers who are squeezed out of the livestock business send their livestock to market much earlier than they otherwise would.
(C) Some people who ate meat regularly in the past are converting to diets that include little or no meat.
(D) As meat prices rise, the number of livestock producers is likely to rise again.
(E) Livestock producers who stay in the business will start using feed other than corn more extensively than they did in the past.

(A) United States manufacturers of tobacco products had higher profits in 1976 than in 1973.
(B) Per capita consumption of cigarettes in the United States was lower in 1976 than in 1973.
(C) The proportion of nonsmokers in the United States population dropped slightly between 1973 and 1976.

Many large department stores in Montalia now provide shopping carts for their customers. Since customers using shopping carts tend to buy more than those without shopping carts, most of these stores are experiencing strong sales growth, while most other department stores are not. Therefore, in order to boost sales, managers of Jerrod's, Montana's premier department store, are planning to purchase shopping carts and make them available to the store's customers next month. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, casts most doubt whether the managers' plan, if implemented, will achieve its goal?
(A) Since most customers associate shopping carts with low-quality discount stores, Jerrod's high-quality image would likely suffer if shopping carts were introduced.
(B) Because the unemployment rate has declined to very low levels, Jerrod's now has to pay significantly higher wages in order to retain its staff.
(C) A number of department stores that did not make shopping carts available to their customers have had to close recently due to falling profits.
(D) Shopping carts are not very expensive, but they generally need to be replaced every few years.
(E) Stores that make shopping carts available to their customers usually have to hire people to retrieve the carts from parking areas.

A mosquito bite can transmit to a person the parasite that causes malaria, and the use of mosquito nets over children's beds can significantly reduce the incidence of malarial infection for children in areas where malaria is common. Yet public health officials are reluctant to recommend the use of mosquito nets over children's beds in such areas.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would provide the strongest grounds for the public health officials' reluctance?
(A) Early exposure to malaria increases the body's resistance to it and results in a lesser likelihood of severe life-threatening episodes of malaria.
(B) Mosquito bites can transmit to people diseases other than malaria.
(C) Mosquito nets provide protection from some insect pests other than mosquitoes.
(D) Although there are vaccines available for many childhood diseases, no vaccine has been developed that is effective against malaria.
(E) The pesticides that are most effective against mosquitoes in regions where malaria is common have significant detrimental effects on human health.

A diet high in saturated fats increases a person's risk of developing heart disease. Regular consumption of red wine reduces that risk. Per-capita consumption of saturated fats is currently about the same in France as in the United States, but there is less heart disease there than in the United States because consumption of red wine is higher in France. The difference in regular red-wine consumption has been narrowing, but no similar convergence in heart-disease rates has occurred. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to account for the lack of convergence noted above?
(A) Consumption of saturated fats is related more strongly to the growth of fatty deposits on artery walls, which reduce blood flow to the heart, than it is to heart disease directly.
(B) Over the past 30 years, per-capita consumption of saturated fats has remained essentially unchanged in the United States but has increased somewhat in France.
(C) Reports of the health benefits of red wine have led many people in the United States to drink red wine regularly.
(D) Cigarette smoking, which can also contribute to heart disease, is only slightly more common in France than in the United States.
(E) Regular consumption of red wine is declining dramatically among young adults in France, and heart disease typically does not manifest itself until middle age.

Researchers took a group of teenagers who had never smoked and for one year tracked whether they took up smoking and how their mental health changed. Those who began smoking within a month of the study's start were four times as likely to be depressed at the study's end than those who did not begin smoking. Since nicotine in cigarettes changes brain chemistry, perhaps thereby affecting mood, it is likely that smoking contributes to depression in teenagers. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A) Participants who were depressed at the study's start were no more likely to be smokers at the study's end than those who were not depressed.
(B) Participants who began smoking within a month of the study's start were no more likely than those who began midway through to have quit smoking by the study's end.
(C) Few, if any, of the participants in the study were friends or relatives of other participants.

Which of the following most logically completes the passage?<br><br>A certain tropical island received food donations in the form of powdered milk for distribution to its poorest residents, who were thought to be malnourished. Subsequently, the rate of liver cancers among those islanders increased sharply. The donated milk was probably to blame: recent laboratory research on rats has shown that rats briefly exposed to the substances aflatoxin tend to develop liver cancer when fed casein, a milk protein. This result is relevant because.
(A) in the tropics, peanuts, a staple of these island residents, support a mold growth that produces aflatoxin
(B) the liver is more sensitive to carcinogens, of which aflatoxin may be one, than most other bodily organs
(C) casein is not the only protein contained in milk

Insect infestations in certain cotton-growing regions of the world have caused dramatic increases in the price of cotton on the world market. By contrast, the price of soybeans has long remained stable. Knowing that cotton plants mature quickly, many soybean growers in Ortovia plan to cease growing soybeans and begin raising cotton instead, thereby taking advantage of the high price of cotton to increase their income significantly, at least over the next several years. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the plan's chances for success?
(A) The cost of raising soybeans has increased significantly over the past several years and is expected to continue to climb.
(B) Tests of a newly developed, inexpensive pesticide have shown it to be both environmentally safe and effective against the insects that have infested cotton crops.
(C) In the past several years, there has been no sharp increase in the demand for cotton and for goods made out of cotton.
(D) Few consumers would be willing to pay significantly higher prices for cotton goods than they are now paying.
(E) The species of insect that has infested cotton plants has never been known to attack soybean plants.

People with a certain eye disorder are virtually unable to see in moderately bright light, which seems to them unbearably intense, since the cells of their retinas are overwhelmed by moderately bright light. These people do, however, show normal sensitivity to most components of dim light. Their retinal cells are also not excessively sensitive to red components of moderately bright light. <br><br>The information above best supports which of the following hypotheses about people with the disorder described, if they have no other serious visual problems?
(A) In all moderately dim light in which people without the disorder can read large print, people with the disorder cannot read such print.
(B) In an otherwise darkened concert hall, these people will see a dimly illuminated red exit sign more clearly than small dim white lights that mark the aisles.
(C) These people typically see more acutely at night and in dim light than do most people who do not have the disorder.
(D) Eyeglasses that are transparent to red components of light but filter out other components of light help these people see in moderately bright light.
(E) These people perceive colors other than red in the same way as do most people who do not have the disorder.

Unprecedented industrial growth in the country of Remo has created serious environmental problems because factories there lack adequate pollution-control systems. Remo is developing a clean growth plan that includes environmental regulations that will require the installation of such systems. Since no companies in Remo currently produce pollution- control systems, the plan, if implemented, will create significant opportunities for foreign exporters to market pollution-control systems. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) The clean growth plan will provide tax incentives for local businesses to develop and manufacture pollution-control devices.
(B) Foreign exporters would provide factory-trained technicians to maintain the pollution- control systems sold to Remo.
(C) Industrial lobbyists sponsored by local businesses in Remo are trying to prevent the implementation of the government regulations.
(D) The regulations that Remo plans to implement are much less strict than those in neighboring nations.

Charcoal from a hearth site in Colorado, 2,000 miles south of Alaska, is known to be 11,200 years old. Researchers reasoned that, since glaciers prevented human migration south from the Alaska-Siberia land bridge between 18,000 and 11,000 years ago, humans must have come to the Americas more than 18,000 years ago. <br><br>Which of the following pieces of new evidence would cast doubt on the conclusion drawn above?

Scientists are discussing ways to remove excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by increasing the amount that is absorbed by plant life. One plan to accomplish this is to establish giant floating seaweed farms in the oceans. When the seaweed plants die, they will be disposed of by being burned for fuel. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, would indicate the most serious weakness in the plan above?
(A) Some areas of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere do not contain sufficient nutrients to support large seaweed farms.
(B) When a seaweed plant is burned, it releases an amount of carbon dioxide comparable to the amount it has absorbed in its lifetime.
(C) Even if seaweed farms prove effective, some people will be reluctant to switch to this new fuel.
(D) Each year about seven billion tons of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere but only about five billion tons are absorbed by plant life.
(E) Seaweed farms would make more money by farming seaweed to sell as nutritional supplements than by farming seaweed to sell as fuel.

In general, jobs are harder to get in times of economic recession because many businesses cut back operations. However, any future recessions in Vargonia will probably not reduce the availability of teaching jobs at government-funded schools. This is because Vargonia has just introduced a legal requirement that education in government-funded schools be available, free of charge, to all Vargonian children regardless of the state of the economy, and that current student-teacher ratios not be exceeded. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A) The current student-teacher ratio at Vargonia's government-funded schools is higher than it was during the most recent period of economic recession.
(B) During recent periods when the Vargonian economy has been strong, almost 25 percent of Vargonian children have attended privately funded schools, many of which charge substantial fees.
(C) Nearly 20 percent more teachers are currently employed in Vargonia's government-funded schools than had been employed in those schools in the period before the last economic recession.
(D) Teachers in Vargonia's government-funded schools are well paid relative to teachers in most privately funded schools in Vargonia, many of which rely heavily on part-time teachers.

Denoma, a major consumer-electronics maker, had a sizeable decline in sales revenue for its most recent fiscal year. This result appears surprising, because electronics retailers report that although their overall sales were considerably lower than in the previous year, their sales revenue from Denoma models actually grew, largely thanks to some innovative and popular models that Denoma introduced. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, does most to explain the apparently surprising result?
(A) Because of the need to educate the public about its new models' capabilities, Denoma's advertising spending was higher than normal over the period.
(B) For the period at issue, Denoma's major competitors reported declines in revenue that were, in percentage terms, greater than Denoma's.
(C) A significant proportion of Denoma's revenue comes from making components for other consumer-electronics manufacturers.
(D) Unlike some of its major competitors, Denoma has no lines of business outside consumer electronics to provide revenue when retail sales of consumer electronics are weak.
(E) During the period, consumer-electronics retailers sold remaining units of Denoma's superseded models at prices that were deeply discounted from those models' original prices.

Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever occur irregularly in East Africa, several years apart. When outbreaks do occur, they kill thousands of cattle. A livestock vaccine against the disease exists but is rarely used. It is too expensive for farmers to use routinely, and since it is not effective until a month after vaccination, administering it after an outbreak begins helps very little. Nevertheless, experts predict that use of the vaccine will increase significantly within the next few years. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest justification for the experts' prediction?
(A) Rift Valley fever is spread by mosquitoes, but each outbreak is so widespread that it is impractical to control it by using insecticides.
(B) When an outbreak of Rift Valley fever occurs, unaffected countries often refuse to import livestock from the countries affected by the outbreak.
(C) It would take less than a month for producers of the vaccine to adjust their production operations to cope with a large increase in demand.
(D) Many cattle farmers in East Africa are nomadic or live in remote villages, and such farmers, who have little access to modern veterinary medicine, are particularly hard hit by outbreaks of Rift Valley fever.
(E) Recently published research has shown that certain identifiable climatic conditions are almost invariably followed, within two to five months, by an outbreak of Rift Valley fever.

The prices of the very same items at the nearest ShopperKing supermarket were totaled and compared with the FoodBasket total. The ShopperKing totals averaged five percent higher than the FoodBasket totals. Nevertheless, this result does not necessarily show that shoppers at ShopperKing would save money overall by shopping at FoodBasket instead, since.
(A) shoppers who shop regularly at a given supermarket generally choose that store for the low prices offered on the items that they purchase most often

Vorland's government is planning a nationwide ban on smoking in restaurants. The objection that the ban would reduce restaurants' revenues is ill founded. Several towns in Vorland enacted restaurant smoking restrictions five years ago. Since then, the amount the government collects in restaurant meal taxes in those towns has increased 34 percent, on average, but only 26 percent elsewhere in Vorland. The amount collected in restaurant meal taxes closely reflects restaurants' revenues. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most undermines the defense of the government's plan?
(A) When the state first imposed a restaurant meal tax, opponents predicted that restaurants' revenues would decline as a result, a prediction that proved to be correct in the short term.

The traditional treatment of strep infections has been a seven-day course of antibiotics, either penicillin or erythromycin. However, since many patients stop taking those drugs within three days, reinfection is common in cases where those drugs are prescribed.

Some residents voiced concern that the rice could threaten certain species of rare migratory birds. Nevertheless, the wildlife agency approved the permits. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to justify the wildlife agency's approval of the permits, given the concerns voiced by some residents?
(A) In the region where the red-winged blackbirds stop, they are the first birds to be present in the spring.

Because mining and refining nickel is costly, researchers have developed an alternative method for extracting nickel using Streptanthus polygaloides, a plant that absorbs and stores nickel form the soil as it grows. The researchers incinerated a crop of Streptanthus they grew in nickel-rich soil. By chemically extracting nickel from the ash, they produced 100 pounds of nickel per acre of land at a total cost per pound slightly above that of current mining. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the conclusion that the use of Streptanthus to extract nickel will be commercially adopted?
(A) The season in which the researchers grew Streptanthus was an unusually favorable one, with the right amount of precipitation to maximize the growth rate of Streptanthus.
(B) Because lowering the concentration of nickel in the soil can make land much better for agriculture in general, a plot on which Streptanthus has been grown and harvested can be sold for substantially more than it cost.
(C) More air pollution is generated for each pound of nickel produced by extracting it from Streptanthus than is generated using conventional mining and refining.
(D) The land on which the researchers planted Streptanthus was unusually free of the various weeds that can compete with Streptanthus for water, nutrients, and sunlight.
(E) It is extremely rare for soil to contain higher concentrations of nickel than the concentrations present in the researchers' experimental plot.

Twenty years ago, Balzania put in place regulations requiring operators of surface mines to pay for the reclamation of mined-out land. Since then, reclamation technology has not improved. Yet, the average reclamation cost for a surface coal mine being reclaimed today is only four dollars per ton of coal that the mine produced, less than half what it cost to reclaim surface mines in the years immediately after the regulations took effect. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to account for the drop in reclamation costs described?
(A) Even after Balzania began requiring surface mine operators to pay reclamation costs, coal mines in Balzania continued to be less expensive to operate than coal mines in almost any other country.
(B) In the twenty years since the regulations took effect, the use of coal as a fuel has declined from the level it was at in the previous twenty years.
(C) Mine operators have generally ceased surface mining in the mountainous areas of Balzania because reclamation costs per ton of coal produced are particularly high for mines in such areas.

Highway Official: When resurfacing our concrete bridges, we should use electrically conductive concrete (ECC) rather than standard concrete. In the winter, ECC can be heated by passing an electric current through it, thereby preventing ice buildup. The cost of the electricity needed is substantially lower than the cost of the de-icing salt we currently use. Taxpayer: But construction costs for ECC are much higher than for standard concrete, so your proposal is probably not justifiable on economic grounds.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, could best be used to support the highway official's proposal in the face of taxpayer's objection?
(A) The use of de-icing salt causes corrosion of the reinforcing steel in concrete bridge decks and damage to the concrete itself, thereby considerably shortening the useful life of concrete bridges.
(B) Severe icing conditions can cause power outages and slow down the work of emergency crews trying to get power restored.
(C) In weather conditions conducive to icing, ice generally forms on the concrete surfaces of bridges well before it forms on parts of the roadway that go over solid ground.
(D) Aside from its potential use for de-icing bridges, ECC might also be an effective means of keeping other concrete structures such as parking garages and airport runways ice free.

(A) A significant proportion of Hill and Dale's sales are made to customers who enter the store in order to buy one particular item but, once there, find other items to buy as well.
(B) In Boravia when the economy is strong, those who might otherwise go camping tend to take vacations overseas.
(C) The economic upturn is likely to allow Boravia's national parks, where most of the camping and hiking is done, to receive extra funding to improve their visitor facilities.
(D) Advances in materials technology have led to the development of hiking and camping equipment that is more comfortable and lightweight than before.
(E) Many people in Boravia not only are committed to preserving the country's wilderness areas but also are interested in spending some time in them.

Electronic computer chips made of tiny silicon wafers now regularly contain millions of electronic switches. Unfortunately, electronic switches that are this small cannot withstand intense radiation. Micro-Mechanics plans to produce a chip that, because it uses only microscopic mechanical switches, will be invulnerable to radiation damage. The switches will, however, be slower than electronic switches and the chip will contain only 12,000 switches. <br><br>For there to be a market for Micro-Mechanics' chip as a result of the apparent advantage described above, each of the following would have to be true EXCEPT:
(A) There will be applications in which the speed attainable by an electronic switch is not essential.
(B) Switches used on electronic chips that contain only 12,000 switches are more vulnerable to radiation damage than the switches on Micro-Mechanics' chip will be.
(C) There will be applications for computer chips in environments where the chips may have to survive intense radiation.
(D) Some devices in which computer chips will be used will have other components that will be able to function during or after exposure to radiation.
(E) Manufacturers are able to protect electronic computer chips against exposure to intense radiation, where this protection is necessary.

In order to raise revenue, the federal government planned a tax amnesty program that allows tax delinquents to pay all owed tax without added financial penalty. However, economists projected that the federal government would collect a far lower percentage of total tax owed by delinquents than did state governments implementing similar programs.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most contribute to an explanation of the economists' projections?
(A) Tax amnesty programs are only successful if they are widely publicized.
(B) Most people who honestly pay their state tax are equally honest in paying their federal tax.
(C) Although federal tax delinquents usually must pay high financial penalties, the states require far lower financial penalties.
(D) The state tax rate varies considerably from state to state, but the federal tax is levied according to laws which apply to citizens of all the states.
(E) Unlike most federal tax delinquents, most state tax delinquents fail to pay state tax because of an oversight rather than a decision not to pay.

Whales originated in the freshwater lakes and rivers of ancient Asia about sixty million years ago. Not until about ten million years later did species of whales develop specialized kidneys enabling them to drink salt water. Although fossil evidence shows that some early whale species that lacked such kidneys sometimes swam in the Earth's saltwater oceans, these species must have had to return frequently to freshwater rivers to drink. <br><br>Which of the following is most strongly supported by the information given?
(A) Fossils of whale species dating from between sixty million and fifty million years ago will not be found on continents that were at the time separated from ancient Asia by wide expanses of ocean.
(B) Among whale fossils that date from later than about fifty million years ago, none are fossils of whale species that drank only fresh water.
(C) Fossils of whale species that drank fresh water will not be found in close proximity to fossils of whale species that drank salt water.
(D) The earliest whales that drank salt water differed from fresh-water-drinking whales only in their possession of specialized kidneys.
(E) Between sixty million and fifty million years ago, the freshwater lakes and rivers in which whales originated were gradually invaded by salt water.

In 1960's studies of rats, scientists found that crowding increases the number of attacks among the animals significantly. But in recent experiments in which rhesus monkeys were placed in crowded conditions, although there was an increase in instances of "coping" behavior—such as submissive gestures and avoidance of dominant individuals—attacks did not become any more frequent. Therefore it is not likely that, for any species of monkey, crowding increases aggression as significantly as was seen in rats. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A) All the observed forms of coping behavior can be found among rhesus monkeys living in uncrowded conditions.
(B) In the studies of rats, nondominant individuals were found to increasingly avoid dominant individuals when the animals were in crowded conditions.
(C) Rhesus monkeys respond with aggression to a wider range of stimuli than any other monkeys do.
(D) Some individual monkeys in the experiment were involved in significantly more attacks than the other monkeys were.
(E) Some of the coping behavior displayed by rhesus monkeys is similar to behavior rhesus monkeys use to bring to an end an attack that has begun.

In the nation of Partoria, large trucks currently account for 6 percent of miles driven on Partoria's roads but are involved in 12 percent of all highway fatalities. The very largest trucks—those with three trailers—had less than a third of the accident rate of single-and double-trailer trucks. Clearly, therefore, one way for Partoria to reduce highway deaths would be to require shippers to increase their use of triple-trailer trucks. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) Partorian trucking companies have so far used triple-trailer trucks on lightly traveled sections of major highways only.
(B) No matter what changes Partoria makes in the regulation of trucking, it will have to keep some smaller roads off-limits to all large trucks.
(C) Very few fatal collisions involving trucks in Partoria are collisions between two trucks.
(D) In Partoria, the safety record of the trucking industry as a whole has improved slightly over the past ten years.

Inflation in the intervening period has been negligible, and the increase has been duly received by all eligible Runagians. <br><br>Nevertheless, many of them are no better off financially than they were before the increase, in large part because
(A) They rely entirely on the government pension for their income

Plankton generally thrive in areas of the ocean with sufficient concentrations of certain nitrogen compounds near the surface, where plankton live. Nevertheless, some areas, though rich in these nitrogen compounds, have few plankton. These areas have particularly low concentrations of iron, and oceanographers hypothesize that this shortage of iron prevents plankton from thriving. However, an experimental release of iron compounds into one such area failed to produce a thriving plankton population, even though local iron concentrations increased immediately. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, argues most strongly against concluding, on the basis of the information above, that the oceanographers' hypothesis is false?
(A) Not all of the nitrogen compounds that are sometimes found in relatively high concentrations in the oceans are nutrients for plankton.
(B) Certain areas of the ocean support an abundance of plankton despite having particularly low concentrations of iron.
(C) The release of the iron compounds did not increase the supply of nitrogen compounds in the area.
(D) A few days after the iron compounds were released, ocean currents displaced the iron-rich water from the surface.
(E) The iron compounds released into the area occur naturally in areas of the ocean where plankton thrive.

Lofgren's disease has been observed frequently in commercially raised cattle but very rarely in chickens. Both cattle and chickens raised for meat are often fed the type of feed that transmits the virus that causes the disease. Animals infected with the virus take more than a year to develop symptoms of Lofgren's disease, however, and chickens commercially raised for meat, unlike cattle, are generally brought to market during their first year of life. <br><br>Which of the following is most strongly supported by the information provided?
(A) The virus that causes Lofgren's disease cannot be transmitted to human beings by chickens.
(B) There is no way to determine whether a chicken is infected with the Lofgren's disease virus before the chicken shows symptoms of the disease.
(C) A failure to observe Lofgren's disease in commercial chicken populations is not good evidence that chickens are immune to the virus that causes this disease.
(D) An animal that has been infected with the virus that causes Lofgren's disease but that has not developed symptoms cannot transmit the disease to an uninfected animal of the same species.
(E) The feed that chickens and cattle are fed is probably not the only source of the virus that causes Lofgren's disease.

Rabbits were introduced to Numa Island in the nineteenth century. Overgrazing by the enormous population of rabbits now menaces the island's agriculture. The government proposes to reduce the population by using a virus that has caused devastating epidemics in rabbit populations elsewhere. There is, however, a chance that the virus will infect the bilby, an endangered native marsupial. The government's plan, therefore, may serve the interests of agriculture but will clearly increase the threat to native wildlife. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) There is less chance that the virus will infect domestic animals on Numa than that it will infect bilbies.
(B) There are no species of animals on the island that prey on the rabbits.
(C) Overgrazing by rabbits endangers many of the plants on which bilbies feed.
(D) The virus that the government proposes to use has been successfully used elsewhere to control populations of rabbits.
(E) There is no alternative means of reducing the rabbit population that would involve no threat to the bilby.

Mice that have been given morphine are very likely to develop blood poisoning because bacteria that normally reside in the intestine typically respond to morphine by migrating into the bloodstream. However, when mice are given both morphine and the new drug naltrexone, blood poisoning is much less frequent, although it does still occur. These results provide support for researchers' prediction that naltrexone will turn out to be toxic to certain types of bacteria.<br><br>Which of the following, if discovered to be true, would most seriously weaken the support for the researchers' prediction?
(A) After being administered to mice, naltrexone does not pass from the bloodstream into the intestine.
(B) Naltrexone inhibits morphine from triggering the migration of intestinal bacteria into the bloodstream.
(C) Mice that have been given naltrexone but not morphine have no greater risk of developing blood poisoning than do mice that have not been given either substance.
(D) The increased risk of blood poisoning is not the only harmful effect on mice of being given morphine.
(E) Conditions other than the presence of intestinal bacteria in the bloodstream can cause blood poisoning in mice.

Industrial accidents are more common when some of the people in safety-sensitive jobs have drinking problems than when none do. Since, even after treatment, people who have had drinking problems are somewhat more likely than other people to have drinking problems in the future, any employer trying to reduce the risk of accidents should bar anyone who has ever been treated for a drinking problem from holding a safety-sensitive job. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument above?
(A) Some companies place employees who are being treated for drinking problems in residential programs and allow them several weeks of paid sick leave.
(B) Many accidents in the workplace are the result of errors by employees who do not hold safety-sensitive jobs.
(C) Workers who would permanently lose their jobs if they sought treatment for a drinking problem try instead to conceal their problem and continue working for as long as possible.

A major chemical spill occurred five years ago at Baker's Beach, the world's sole nesting ground for Merrick sea turtles, and prevented nearly all the eggs laid that year from hatching. Yet the number of adult female Merricks returning to lay their eggs at Baker's Beach has actually increased somewhat since five years ago. Clearly, environmentalists' prediction that the world's Merrick population would decline as a result of the spill has proven unfounded. <br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument offered in refutation of the environmentalists' prediction?
(A) The chemical spill five years ago occurred at a time when there were neither Merrick sea turtles nor Merrick sea turtle eggs on Baker's Beach.
(B) Female Merrick sea turtles begin returning to Baker's Beach to lay their eggs when they are ten years old.
(C) Linder normal conditions, only a small proportion of hatchling female Merrick sea turtles survive in the ocean until adulthood and return to lay their eggs at Baker's Beach.
(D) Environmental pressures unrelated to the chemical spill have caused a significant decline in the population of one of the several species of sea birds that prey on Merrick sea turtle eggs.
(E) After the chemical spill, an environmental group rejected a proposal to increase the Merrick sea turtle population by transferring eggs from Baker's Beach to nearby beaches that had not been affected by the spill.

Editorial: In Ledland, unemployed adults receive government assistance. To reduce unemployment, the government proposes to supplement the income of those who accept jobs that pay less than government assistance, thus enabling employers to hire workers cheaply. However, the supplement will not raise any worker's income above what government assistance would provide if he or she were not gainfully employed. Therefore, unemployed people will have no financial incentive to accept jobs that would entitle them to the supplement. <br><br>Which of the following, if true about Ledland, most seriously weakens the argument of the editorial?
(A) The government collects no taxes on assistance it provides to unemployed individuals and their families.
