  <h4><b>How to Do an SC Problem</b></h4>
  Overall, the main goal when starting any test question is the same: <i>find a starting point</i>. On GMAT Sentence Correction questions, you use that starting point to cross off wrong answers:
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img align="middle" src="../../../assets/img/question/OG15-SC-explanation-01.jpg"/><p>
  <p>That doesn't look too terrible, does it? Unfortunately, it can get more complicated. In Sentence Correction, there are multiple possible locations for that starting point. How do you actually find these Issues that need to be addressed? In addition, how do you know when to guess and move on? </p>
  <p>Your “default” SC process will answer all of these questions.</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">
    Step 1: Take Your <b>First Glance</b><br>
    Step 2: <b>Read</b> the Sentence<br>
    Step 3: <b>Compare</b> the Answers<br>
    Step 4: <b>Decide</b> and Move On<br>
  </p>As you learn this process below, keep two overarching principles in mind:<br></p>
  <p style="padding: 10px 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc!important;">
    <b>
    1.  Whenever  you  find  an  issue  that  you  know  how  to  handle,  tackle  it immediately!<br>
    2.  If you spot a difference that you <i>DON'T</i> know how to handle, ignore it.
    </b>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
  <h4><b>Step 1: Take Your First Glance (3–5 seconds)</b></h4>
  To start, take a First Glance at the problem to spot any clues that will give you some quick hints about potential issues.<br>
  Here's an example:
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img align="middle" src="../../../assets/img/question/OG15-SC-explanation-02.jpg"/><p>
  <p>Do any of those clues tell you what to think about when you read the sentence? <br>For example:</p>
  <p style="padding: 10px 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc!important;">
    <b>First Glance:</b><br>
    The first word of the underline, <i>conditions</i>, varies in the answers.
    Sometimes it's singular (<i>conditions</i>) and sometimes it's plural. I should look for singular / plural issues (either subject–verb or pronouns) when reading the sentence.<br>
    You'll learn how to perform a First Glance as you read these explanations.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
  <h4><b>Step 2: Read the Sentence</b></h4>
  <p>
    After the First Glance, read the original sentence, keeping in mind any clues you might have spotted during the First Glance. Read until you spot something or you reach the period, whichever comes first. As always, whenever you spot something that you know how to handle, tackle it!<br>
    Here's the full example sentence:
  </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 20px;">A majority of analysts believe that the <u>conditions that led to the economic depression has also caused</u> the value of the local currency to drop relative to the currencies of other countries.</p>
  <p>As you're reading, you might think:</p>
  <p style="padding: 10px 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc!important;">Hmm. Conditions is a plural subject. Let's see. The verb is has caused. Conditions has caused…This is wrong!</p>
  <p>Because you found an outright error in the original sentence, you now know that answer (A) is wrong (this answer always repeats the original underline). Cross it off immediately.</p>
  <p>Next, scan the remaining answers and cross off any that repeat this same error. This step is so important that we're going to repeat it:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Any time you find an error, cross off all answers that contain that same error!</b></p>
  <p>Here are the five answers; check the subject–verb pairs:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(A) conditions that led to the economic depression has also caused <br></span>
    (B) conditions <span style="color: darkgray;">that led to the economical depression</span> had also caused <br>
    (C) <span style="color: darkgray;">economic</span> condition <span style="color: darkgray;">that led to the depression</span> have also caused <br>
    (D) <span style="color: darkgray;">economic</span> conditions <span style="color: darkgray;">that led to the depression</span> have also caused <br>
    (E)<span style="color: darkgray;"> economical</span> condition <span style="color: darkgray;">that led to the depression</span> will be causing
  </p>
  <p>In your mind, gray out or try to ignore the pieces that you don't want. Just concentrate on what you need.</p>
  <p>Keep track of your answers on your scrap paper. Answer (A) is already wrong. Answer (C) pairs a     singular subject with a plural verb. Cross both off.</p>
  <p>Okay, what next? You need to find another issue to tackle.</p>

  <p style="padding: 0 40px;">
    Possibility #1: If you spotted anything else while considering your starting point, address that issue next. <br>
    Possibility #2: Return to the original sentence and continue reading until you find a second issue or reach the end of the sentence. <br>
    Possibility #3: Compare the answer choices. (We'll talk more about this below.) <br>
  </p>
  <p>While tackling the subject–verb issue, you might have noticed that those verbs changed tenses as well. Should the sentence be in past perfect, present perfect, or future? If you know, tackle that next.</p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
  <h4><b>Step 3: Compare the Answers</b></h4>
  <p>At some point, you'll go to the answers. The crucial strategy here is to <i>compare the answer choices against each other</i>. Don't just read each choice by itself!</p>
  <p>Here's the example problem again:</p>
  <div style="padding: 10px 40px; border: 1px solid #ccc!important;">
    <p>A majority of analysts believe that the <u>conditions that led to the economic depression has also caused</u> the value of the local currency to drop relative to the currencies of other countries.</p>
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(A) conditions that led to the economic depression has also caused</span> <br>
    (B) conditions that led to the economical depression had also caused <br>
    <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">(C) economic condition that led to the depression have also caused</span> <br>
    (D) economic conditions that led to the depression have also caused <br>
    (E) economical condition that led to the depression will be causing <br>
  </div>
  <p>You've already eliminated (A) and (C) for bad subject–verb agreement. Let's say that you spot the difference in verb tense, but you're not sure how to tackle that. Ignore that issue—don't spend another second on it—and look for something else.</p>
  <p>Compare the remaining answers vertically. What other differences do you spot?</p>
  <p>The word <i>economic</i> changes form—sometimes, the answer uses <i>economical</i> instead. Also, the word moves around; sometimes, it is before the noun <i>depression</i> and other times, it's before the word <i>condition(s)</i>.<br>
  The location of the word is a red herring (something designed to throw you off the trail of the answer). It's acceptable to talk about the <i>economic conditions</i> or the <i>economic depression</i>.</p>
  <p>The form of the word, however, is a major issue. The two words don't mean the same thing!<br>
  Economic refers to the economy; an economic condition is a monetary or business condition. Economical, on the other hand, typically means “in a frugal or cost-effective manner.” Economical condition, then, means the condition itself is cost-effective—which is illogical. Answers (B) and (E) are incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
  <h4><b>Step 4: Choose an Answer and Move On</b></h4>
  <p>At some point, one of two things will happen: you'll get down to one answer or you'll get stuck. If you know the answer, pick it. The answer to the above question is (D).</p>
  <p>If you get stuck at any point along the way, you can try once or twice to unstick yourself (using the techniques discussed in the next section). After that, though, pick an answer and move on.</p>

  <p style="padding: 10px 40px; border: 1px solid #ccc">
    Do <i>NOT</i> agonize back and forth between the final two answers. Compare once, then pick and move on!
  </p>
  <p>Expect to average roughly 1 minute 20 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds on Sentence Correction. If you're approaching the 2-minute mark and you're stuck, stop being stubborn! Choose an answer and start your next question.</p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
  <h4><b>Why Ignoring Is Often a Wise Thing To Do</b></h4>
  <p>In the example above, notice that you got all the way to the answer without having to decide which verb tense was right (<i>had caused</i> versus <i>have caused</i> versus <i>will be causing</i>). That's not unusual. Many wrong answers are wrong for more than one reason, and, when the clock is ticking, you need to find just one reason to cross off an answer. On the test itself, go for the easiest material first and avoid the difficult fights as much as possible.</p>
  <p>When you're studying, after you're done with the test or problem set, go back and review everything that was going on in each problem. Then ask yourself whether there is a better path to the answer, given what you know now.</p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
  <h4><b>How to Handle Harder Questions</b></h4>
  <p>What happens when you don't spot a starting point in the original sentence—or you don't even
    understand what the original sentence means? What about when the splits, or differences among the
    answers, are not very easy to compare? For example, a modifier might appear at the beginning of one
    answer choice but at the end of another.</p>
  <p>When this happens, be flexible. If you can't understand the meaning itself, read it again—but, this
    time, try to break it into more manageable parts. Try to find a subject and a verb and picture just that
    action or activity. Ignore any modifiers. Once you have the basic idea, add any other subjects or verbs
    into the picture, and, finally, add in the modifiers.</p>
  <p>If the most confusing portion is the underlined portion, try substituting a different answer choice into
    the sentence. If that still doesn't work, guess and move on.</p>
  <p>If you do understand the sentence but you're struggling to find a starting point, try these two tactics:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Compare the beginning word of each answer choice. Also compare the ending word of each choice. Do those differences give you any clues about what the sentence might be testing?</li>
    <li>Compare answer (A), which you've already read, to answer (B). Concentrate only on differences between the two and ask yourself what those differences could possibly be testing.</li>
    </ol>
  <p>When the answer choices are changing so much that they're difficult to compare, you're going to start looking at chunks of the sentence. (We call a string of words that goes together, such as a modifier, a chunk.) Let's say that a modifier is jumping around in the answers. Find the equivalent modifier chunk in each choice and see where it attaches to the main sentence.</p>
  <p>Here's an example:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
    (A) Manufactured in Germany, engineers in Japan designed the car.<br>
    (B) Manufactured in Germany, Japanese engineers had designed the car.<br>
    (C) Japanese engineers, manufactured in Germany, designed the car.<br>
    (D) Japanese engineers designed the car and manufactured in Germany.<br>
    (E) Japanese engineers designed the car, which was manufactured in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>
    The modifier <i>manufactured in Germany</i> moves around in the sentence. Furthermore, in one case, the
    modifier is no longer a modifier—it has become part of the core of the sentence. (If you missed that,
    look at the answers again. Can you find it?)</p>
  <p>Because <i>manufactured in Germany</i> was a modifier at first, start by examining the choices in that
    context. Logically, the <i>car</i> was <i>manufactured in Germany</i>, so the modifier has to be placed to make
    this clear.</p>
  <p>In answers (A) and (B), the sentence implies that the <i>engineers</i> were <i>manufactured in Germany</i>. That's illogical, so cross off (A) and (B).</p>
  <p>What happens in (C)? The modifier is closer to the word <i>car</i>. Is it close enough? Nope. It's even
    closer to the noun <i>engineers</i>; plus, the verb <i>designed</i> separates the modifier from the word <i>car</i>. The
    modifier is still talking about the <i>engineers</i>. Eliminate (C).</p>
  <p>Skip answer (D) for the moment (this is the one in which the modifier turned into part of the sentence
    core). Answer (E) properly places the modifier right next to the word <i>car</i>. Answer (E) is okay on this
    modifier issue, so leave it in.</p>
  <p>Back to (D). In this choice, the word <i>manufactured</i> is now one of the main verbs: <i>the engineers</i>
    <i>designed and manufactured</i>. This sentence, then, doesn't violate the modifier rule. You'll need
    another starting point to decide between (D) and (E).</p>
  <p>After you've done some work and understand the explanations, come back to this one and see whether you can articulate
    why the correct answer is (E).</p>
