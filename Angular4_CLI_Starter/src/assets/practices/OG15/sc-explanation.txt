	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Structure</b>
			<p>Like many GMAT sentences, this one begins with an opening modifier, followed by the subject of the sentence, <i>two psychologists</i>, and then another modifier, <i>declaring that</i>. What verb goes with the subject?</p>
			<p>Although the modifier <i>declaring that…size</i> is not incorrect because it could potentially modify <i>psychologists</i>, a modifier cannot contain the sentence's main verb, so it can't help with the missing verb problem. The next and final chunk of the sentence, <i>none could be taken seriously</i>, is a complete clause on its own and does not contain a verb for <i>psychologists</i>. Answer (A) is just a sentence fragment.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) is similar. It adds an and to the final clause, but the sentence still has no main verb to go with the subject <i>psychologists</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) fix the missing verb problem by changing the modifier <i>declaring</i> into a main verb form: <i>declared</i>. Answer (C) creates another missing verb problem, though: <i>most of the studies</i> is also a subject that needs a verb but answer (C) replaces the verb <i>failed</i> with the modifier <i>having failed</i>. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Verb: <i>fail</i></b>
			<p>Scan the answers and note that there are three variations in verb tense: <i>had failed, failed</i>, and <i>fail</i>. When did the studies fail?</p>
			<p>The full clause states that since the studies <i>fail / failed / had failed, none could be taken seriously</i>. The verb form <i>could be</i> is either indicating a past tense or a polite statement or request (Could you please do this for me?). In this sentence, <i>could be</i> is indicating a past time frame, so <i>fail</i> shouldn't be in the present tense. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (E) all use acceptable past tenses; answer (C) changes the structure (see the discussion of Structure for more).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Idiom: <i>failed in controlling</i></b>
			<p>The answers contain a split between <i>failed in controlling</i> in answers (B) and (D) and <i>failed to control</i> in answers (A), (C), and (E). Are both versions acceptable?</p>
			<p>Try some simpler examples. She failed to control her temper. She failed in controlling her temper. The first example is the correct idiom; the second is incorrect. If some action is what failed to happen, use the infinitive form (in this case, <i>to control</i>) rather than the gerund form as the object of a preposition (in this case, <i>in controlling</i>). Eliminate answers (B) and (D).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Comparison: <i>such X like Y</i></b>
			<p>Towards the end of the underlined section, there is a split between <i>such variables as social class</i> and <i>such variables like social class</i>.</p>
			<p>The word <i>like</i> means “similar to.” This sentence is trying to introduce examples of something; thecorrect idiom for introducing examples is <i>such as</i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (D).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
<b>The Correct Answer</b><br>
<p>Correct answer (E) contains a subject and a verb for both <i>psychologists</i> and <i>most of the studies</i>. It also uses the correct idiom, <i>such as</i>, to provide an example.</p>

			<p>The pronoun <i>they</i> must be referring to <i>manufacturers</i> (before the semicolon) because batteries cannot rate things. The second half, then, says: <i>if manufacturers rate</i> [batteries] <i>higher</i>, then the battery will last longer.</p>
			<p>The manufacturers could make longer-lasting batteries, but answer (A) implies that simply changing the rating given to a battery will cause it to last longer.

	The very short underline makes it worthwhile to study the differences in the answers before reading the sentence. The answers start with a verb that changes from plural to singular, indicating a subject–verb issue.
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>have raised</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence says <i>a surge have raised hopes</i>. <i>Surge</i> is singular and <i>have raised</i> is plural. Answer (A) is incorrect because of bad subject–verb agreement. The remaining answers contain singular verbs that match with the singular noun <i>surge</i>. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Note that the simple past tense verb form, <i>raised</i>, and the past perfect verb form, <i>had raised</i>, can be plural or singular, as in <i>they had raised</i> or <i>it has raised</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had raised</i></b></p>
			<p>Scan the answers and note that there are three variations in verb tense: <i>raised, had raised</i>, and <i>has raised</i>. When were the hopes raised?</p>
			<p><i>The economists say</i> (present tense) something today, so the surge might be in the present or past. Simple past or present perfect are both acceptable, but the past perfect <i>had raised</i> in answer (C) is problematic. Past perfect requires either another verb in simple past or a past time marker, but neither exists in this sentence. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Idiom: <i>hopes for</i></b></p>
			<p>Towards the middle of the underlined section, there is a split between <i>hopes that</i>, in answers (A) and (D), and <i>hopes for</i>, in answers (B), (C), and (E).</p>
			<p>Although <i>hopes for</i> and <i>hopes that</i> can both be correct idioms, check that each is used correctly.</p>
			<p><i>Hopes for</i> should be followed by a noun, whereas <i>hopes that</i> should be followed by a clause. For example, both of these sentences are idiomatically correct: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	She hopes for a reconciliation.
	She hopes that a reconciliation will occur.
			</pre>
			<p>But these two sentences are not idiomatically correct:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	She hopes for a reconciliation will occur.
	She hopes that a reconciliation.
			</pre>
			<p>In all of the answer choices, the portion after <i>hopes for</i> or <i>hopes that</i> is a clause. Answers (A) and (D) correctly use <i>hopes that</i>. Answers (B), (C), and (E) incorrectly use <i>hopes for</i>; eliminate these answers.</p>
			<p>Although some might not like the use of the expression <i>there being</i> in answer (B), it means “the existence of” and is not, in and of itself, a grammatically incorrect expression.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	In correct answer (D), <i>has raised</i> agrees in number with the subject and works with the present tense <i>economists</i> say and recovery is. Answer (D) also uses the correct idiom <i>hopes for</i>.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>not only X, but also Y; not only X, but Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The underline begins someone not only who. Not only can introduce the idiom not only X, but also Y (or the less common but acceptable not only X, but Y). Check for both proper idiom construction and parallelism between the X and the Y portions.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) someone not only <span style="color:red;">who could arrange</span> 	but <span style="color:red;">mirroring</span>
	(B) someone who could not only <span style="color:green;">arrange</span> 	but also <span style="color:green;">mirror</span>

	(E) someone not only <span style="color:red;">who could arrange</span> 	but <span style="color:red;">mirror</span>
			</pre>
			<p>All five choices use either not only X, but also Y or not only X, but Y. All are correct in this respect. Next, check for parallelism. Note that the words before not only should apply to both the X and the Y portions of the sentence. For example, answer (A) says someone who could arrange and someone mirroring. The second modifier isn't parallel to the first and also creates an ungrammatical structure.</p>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) are also not parallel and create ungrammatical structures. Eliminate answers (A), (C), (D) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>in finishing</i>; <i>for finishing</i>; <i>finishing</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence indicates that Duke Ellington looked for someone with two specific traits so that the person would be able to carry on his work: <i>someone who could not only X, but also Y in order to [accomplish] Z</i>. Answers (A) and (B) both contain the <i>in order to</i> language, but the other three answers offer different variations:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(C) mirror his writing style <span style="color:red;">in finishing</span> the many pieces
	(D) mirror his writing style <span style="color:red;">for finishing</span> the many pieces
	(E) mirror his writing style, <span style="color:red;">finishing</span> the many pieces
			</pre>
			<p>In answer (C), <i>in finishing</i> could be an acceptable construction in general but it doesn't convey the same meaning as <i>in order to</i>: Ellington specifically looked for the two traits <i>in order to</i> have a certain result. In answer (D), the words <i>style for finishing</i> seem to be describing the style of the writer: the writer's existing or preferred style is to finish the many pieces Ellington hadn't finished. That's illogical. Finally, answer (E) offers extra information—this person would also happen to finish Ellington's pieces. Again, the sentence loses the original intention: someone with these two traits would be chosen in order to finish the works. Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>is</i></b></p>
			<p>The main clause uses two tenses: <i>none is</i> (present) <i>more concentrated as the wave that brought</i> (past).</p>
			<p>The present tense <i>is</i> cannot correctly describe an action that occurred in the past. The <i>wave that brought 12 million immigrants</i> occurred in the past, so this event <i>was more concentrated</i>. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Answers (B) and (C) also use <i>is</i> to discuss an action that occurred in the past; eliminate both.

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>rank; are; have</i></b></p>
			<p>The verb at the beginning of each answer choice flips back and forth between singular and plural.</p>
			<p>The subject is <i>diabetes</i>. The phrase <i>together with its serious complications</i> is a modifier, not part of the main subject. Although the word <i>diabetes</i> ends in an s, the singular pronoun its in the modifier indicates that <i>diabetes</i> is a singular word.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) uses the plural verb <i>rank</i>, answer (D) uses the plural verb <i>are</i>, and answer (E) uses the plural verb <i>have</i>. Eliminate all three.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>only</i></b></p>
			<p>The word <i>only</i> moves around in the answers.</p>
			<p><i>Only</i> is an adverb; it modifies some other word or set of words in the sentence. In answers (A) and (D), <i>only</i> modifies the prepositional phrase following it: <i>only by heart disease and cancer</i>. In answers (B), (C), and (E), <i>only</i> modifies the verb following it: <i>only surpassed</i>. Both variations might sound fine, but <i>only surpassed</i> is incorrect. Consider these two examples:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	She works only between 8pm and 11pm.
	She only works between 8pm and 11pm.
			</pre>
			<p>In the first option, if she is going to work, she will only do so between the hours of 8pm and 11pm. She may also do other things during those hours, such as eating and sleeping. The word “only” limits the hours that she works.</p>
			<p>In the second option, between 8pm and 11pm, she does nothing else but work. She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep…she does nothing except work. The word “only” limits the activity described by the verb.</p>
			<p>The meaning of the given sentence matches the first example: <i>Diabetes is surpassed only by</i> the two given diseases and no others. The word <i>only</i> should modify the two diseases. Eliminate answers (B), (C), and (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (A) pairs the singular subject <i>diabetes</i>, with the singular verb <i>ranks</i>. This answer also logically presents <i>diabetes</i> as the <i>third leading cause of death</i> and correctly uses <i>only</i> to modify <i>heart disease and cancer</i>.

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier</b><br></p>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>because of moisture raising</i></b></p>
			<p>The answers contain a split between <i>due to</i> and <i>because of</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Due to</i> X modifies a noun. Consider this example: His success was due to hard work. In this sentence, “due to hard work” modifies “success,” meaning that his hard work resulted in success.</p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the <i>moisture</i> resulted <i>in cleaning and repair</i>. This is true indirectly, but really the moisture caused a series of events: The humidity increased, causing the salt to crystallize, and as a result of that, the chambers were closed for cleaning and repair. The <i>moisture</i> didn't result directly in <i>cleaning and repair</i>. Look for a choice that offers a more clear causal sequence. Eliminate answers (A) and (B) for faulty meaning.</p>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) all use <i>because</i>—one step in the right direction. Answer (C) still maintains a muddled meaning, though: <i>The chambers were closed because tourists were exhaling moisture</i>. Again, this is true only indirectly. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
			<p>In answer (D), <i>because of moisture raising</i> is not a preferred idiomatic construction. A better idiomatic structure would be <i>because moisture raised</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>its</i></b></p>
			<p>Two answers use the singular <i>its</i>; three answers use the plural <i>them</i>.</p>
			<p>The sentence indicates that <i>the chambers inside the pyramid were closed</i> because of problems; this doesn't necessarily mean that the entire pyramid was closed or affected by the humidity issues. The pronoun, then, should refer to the plural chambers, not the singular <i>pyramid</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>such X so that Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the construction <i>raised its humidity to such levels so that salt was crystallizing</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Such X so that Y</i> is not a correct idiom. One correct idiom is <i>such X that Y</i>. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The word <i>and</i> appears immediately after the underline ends, signaling an <i>X and Y</i> parallel structure.</p>
			<p>The Y portion is <i>fungus was growing</i>. Which X structures are parallel?</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

	<span style="color:green;">(E) the stone was crystallizing</span>
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A) and (E) are both parallel. In answers (B) and (C), the <i>would</i> structure doesn't make sense; the salt must already have crystallized, just as the fungus already grew, because <i>the chambers</i> were closed as a result.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>those; that</i></b><br>
			<b>Comparison: <i>X less than Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the pronoun <i>those</i> to refer to the <i>41 million tons of rice</i>. Answer (E) changes the plural <i>those</i> to the singular <i>that</i>, which refers back to <i>production</i>.</p>
			<p>Replace the pronoun with the noun. The original sentence reads <i>Lack of rain reduced production to 41 million tons, 25 percent less than the tons of the 1978 harvest</i>. Nothing can be <i>25 percent less than</i> a number of <i>tons</i>, because <i>tons</i> is a countable noun; if the comparison were between the two numbers of <i>tons</i>, the sentence would have to use <i>fewer than</i>. Eliminate answer (A) and note that the <i>fewer than / less than</i> split is definitely at issue.</p>
			<p>Answer (E) does use <i>fewer than</i>, but it also changes the pronoun to <i>that</i>. Now, the sentence reads: <i>Lack of rain reduced production to 41 million tons, 25 percent fewer than the production of the 1978 harvest</i>. <i>Production</i> is not a countable noun; it needs the comparison marker <i>less than</i>. Further, <i>production</i> and <i>harvest</i> are synonyms, so <span style="color:red;"><i>production of the harvest</i></span> is redundant. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>Check the remaining answers for <i>X less than Y</i> or <i>X fewer than Y</i> issues. The comparison must be correctly constructed, and the X and Y portions must be properly parallel.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) reduced <span style="color:green;">rice production</span> to 41 million tons, 25 percent less than the <span style="color:green;">1978 harvest</span>
	(C) reduced <span style="color:red;">rice production</span> to 41 million tons, 25 percent less than <span style="color:red;">1978</span>
	(D) reduced <span style="color:red;">rice production</span> to 41 million tons, 25 percent fewer than <span style="color:red;">1978</span>
			</pre>
			<p><i>Less than</i> can be used to compare numerical quantities while <i>fewer than</i> is used to compare countable nouns. Answer (C) compares the amount produced during the 1979 harvest to the year 1978; this comparison is illogical. Answer (D) incorrectly uses <i>fewer than</i> to refer to the <i>production</i>. <i>Production</i> is not a countable noun. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>The <i>less than</i> versus <i>fewer than</i> issue is tricky in this problem because the sentence includes the number <i>41 million tons</i>. It's certainly possible to compare the number of tons in 1979 to the number in 1978. However, this sentence also uses <i>25 percent</i>. Try this out in a simple sentence: M is 25 percent <span style="color:green;"><i>less than</i></span> N. M is 25 percent <span style="color:red;"><i>fewer than</i></span> N. The first version is correct.</p>

<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) is a logical comparison between the amount produced during the 1979 harvest and the amount produced during the 1978 harvest. It also uses <i>less than</i>, a correct comparison for the uncountable noun <i>production</i>.

		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom / Structure: <i>holds that</i></b></p>
			<p>The last word before the underline is the verb <i>holds</i>. Answers (A), (B), and (C) all start with a <i>that</i>, whereas answers (D) and (E) do not.</p>
			<p>This sentence is another example of the<span style="color: blue;"> Subject–Verb-THAT-Subject–Verb</span> sentence structure. Because the verb <i>holds</i> is followed by a clause, the word <i>that</i> is needed. Cross off answers (D) and (E) for omitting the word <i>that</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Verb: <i>had begun; to have begun</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence has two verbs in different tenses bound together by an <i>and</i> in the second clause. Check the options that use and for Meaning or Parallelism issues:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) universe <i style="color: green;">began</i> 		and <i style="color: green;">has been expanding</i>
	(B) universe <i style="color: red;">had begun</i> 		and <i style="color: red;">had been expanding</i>
	(E) universe <i style="color: red;">to have begun</i>	and <i style="color: red;">has been expanding</i>
			</pre>			
			<p>In answer (A), the verbs <span style="color:green;"><i>began</i></span> and <span style="color:green;"><i>has been expanding</i></span> are correctly used because it is logical to say that first the universe <i>began</i> (in the past) and that <i>it has been expanding</i> ever since then.</p>
			<p>In answer (B), <span style="color:red;"><i>had begun</i></span> (past perfect) is incorrect because there isn't another simple past event or past time marker in the sentence. Similarly, since the intended meaning is that the universe is still expanding, <i><span style="color:red;">had been expanding</span></i> is also incorrect because it implies that the universe is no longer expanding. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>In answer (E), <span style="color:red;"><i>to have begun</i></span> is confusing. Is this a verb tense? An infinitive? Whatever it is, it's connected to <i>has been expanding</i> by the word <i>and</i>, so parallelism is required. Something that starts with an infinitive cannot be parallel to a conjugated verb tense. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>An entirely different structure is used in answers (C) and (D). The word <i>and</i> has turned into <i>that</i>, so examine these two choices for modifier issues (see below).</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>that has expanded; that is expanding</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (D) change the original parallel X and Y structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color:red;">(C) the beginning was an explosive instant that has expanded</span>
	<span style="color:red;">(D) the beginning to have been an explosive instant that is expanding</span>
			</pre>

			<p>The two noun modifiers, <i style="color: green;">that has expanded</i> and <i style="color: green;">that is expanding</i>, logically describe the <i style="color: green;">universe</i>.</p>
			<p>However, the closest main noun is the explosive <i style="color: red;">instant</i>—the moment the universe began. An instant can't expand; this is nonsensical. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (A) has two verbs that work logically together: <span style="color:green;"><i>The universe began and has been expanding ever since</i></span>. In addition, the sentence correctly uses the Subject–Verb-That-Subject–Verb structure.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>like X, Y; as X, Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the comparison <i style="color: blue;">like</i> X, Y; the word <i style="color: blue;">like</i> is a comparison marker. Comparisons require parallelism between the X and Y portions:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) <i style="color: red;">Like</i> the idolization, 		Joyce and Woolf
	(B) <i style="color: red;">As</i> the idolization, 		Joyce and Woolf

	(D) <i style="color: red;">As</i> it is, 				Joyce and Woolf are
	(E) <i style="color: green;">Like</i> the Brontës and Brownings, 	Joyce and Woolf
			</pre>
			<p>Since James Joyce and Virginia Woolf are people (they are famous 18th-century writers), they should be compared to other people. Answers (A) and (B) compare them to <i style="color: red;">idolization</i>; answer (C) compares them to something <i style="color: red;">that</i> can be <i style="color: blue;">accorded to the Brontës and Brownings</i> (who are famous 19th-century writers). Although it isn't clear exactly what <i style="color: red;">that</i> refers to, <i style="color: red;">that</i> cannot refer to people.</p>
			<p>Likewise, answer (D) compares Joyce and Woolf to it, another pronoun that can't refer to people. In contrast, answer (E) correctly compares the two sets of writers. Eliminate answers (A), (B), (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>The comparison structures also test another issue: <i style="color: blue;">like</i> versus <i style="color: blue;">as</i>. The comparison <i style="color: blue;">as X, Y</i>, used in answers (B) and (D), is used to compare clauses. However, in answer (B), <i style="color: red;">the Brontës’ and the Brownings’ idolization</i> does not contain a verb; it is not a clause, so as cannot be used for the comparison. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>that, it</i></b></p>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, answers (C) and (D) each contain a pronoun. Answer (C) uses <i style="color: blue;">that</i> and answer (D) uses <i style="color: blue;">it</i>.</p>
			<p>Because the comparison structure requires parallelism, the word <i style="color: red;">that</i> in answer (C) appears to refer to Joyce and Woolf. Logically, though, <i style="color: blue;">that</i> really refers to veneration. Answer (D) presents a similar problem with the pronoun <i style="color: red;">it</i>.

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>This sentence is complex! Try to understand the meaning before diving in. The sentence initially states that <i style="color: blue;">there are several ways to build solid mud walls</i> and then describes <i style="color: blue;">the most extensively used method of doing so</i>. The underlined section explains the two parts to this method: forming the bricks and then laying them in the wall. The parallelism marker <i style="color: blue;">and</i> signals the <i style="color: blue;">X and Y</i> structure.</p>
			<p>Check for parallelism in the description of the wall building method:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) has been <span style="color:red;">the forming</span> of bricks 	and <span style="color:red;">they are laid</span>
	(B) has been <span style="color:red;">forming</span> the mud or clay 	and <span style="color:red;">to lay</span>
	(C) has been <span style="color:red;">having bricks formed</span> 	and <span style="color:red;">they were laid</span>
	(D) has been <span style="color:green;">to form</span> the mud or clay 	and <span style="color:green;">to lay</span>
	(E) has been that bricks were formed, 	<span style="color:blue;">which were laid</span>
			</pre>
			<p> Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) contain the parallel marker and, but answers (A), (B), and (C) are not structurally parallel. Answer (D) is parallel because the infinitive <i style="color: green;">to form</i> matches the infinitive to lay. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (C).</p>
			<p>Note that, in answer (E), the <i style="color: blue;">and</i> becomes a <i style="color: blue;">which</i>. Which signals the start of a modifier, not a parallel structure, so that modifier needs to be investigated.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>which were laid</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (E), unlike the others, uses <i style="color: red;">which</i> instead of <i style="color: green;">and</i> to link the two steps together. Although you would expect a parallel structure here (see the discussion of parallelism for more), can the which also be correct?</p>
			<p>What is the modifier describing? Examine this section of the sentence:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	bricks were formed from mud or clay, which were laid
			</pre>
			<p>Logically, the bricks were laid. This structure, though, illogically implies that the mud or clay was laid somewhere. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>Note that the GMAT test writer was really clever. An adverbial modifier (<i>after some preliminary air drying or sun drying</i>) is sitting right in the middle of the noun modifier. This is completely acceptable from a grammar standpoint and makes it much harder to spot the problem with the noun modifier.</p>

			<p>The simple past tense <i style="color: red;">were</i> indicates that the action was completed in the past: <i style="color: red;">The rising inventories were unaccompanied by sales increases</i>.

			<p>The original sentence has this core structure: <i style="color: blue;">many experts regarded the increase not as a sign that…, rather a sign</i>. Check the comparison to ensure that it is both idiomatically correct and parallel.</p>
			<p>The basic structure is this: <i style="color: red;">regarded the increase not as X, rather Y</i>. This idiom is incorrect; the construction needs a conjunction that indicates contrast, such as <i style="color: green;">not X, but Y</i>.</p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) use incorrect comparison idioms (<i style="color: red;">not X, rather Y or not X, yet Y</i>). Answer (E) uses <i style="color: red;">not X, but also Y</i>.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence describes a contrast: sunspots are visible (they've been seen on the surface of the Sun) but they can't be seen at the poles or the equator. Examine the meaning of this portion of answer (B): <i style="color: red;">visible as dark spots that never have been sighted.</i></p>
			<p>This language says that the <i style="color: blue;">spots</i> are both <i style="color: red;">visible</i> and <i style="color: red;">have never been sighted</i>. Both of those things can't be true at once. Rather, the <i style="color: blue;">spots</i> have been sighted in some locations but not in others. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b><br>
			<b>Modifier / Meaning: which</b></p>
			<p>When examining the Meaning issue, above, you might also spot a Structure issue in answer (B): <i style="color: red;">spots that have never been sighted on the surface of the Sun the Sun's poles or equator.</i></p>
			<p>Ignoring the illogical meaning for a moment, the sentence appears to discuss a list of three things: <i style="color: red;">the surface of the Sun, the Sun's poles, or the equator</i>. At the very least, the list is missing commas. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>Check the other answers for Structure issues:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) <i style="color: green;">sunspots</i> are visible <i style="color: green;">	but</i> have never been sighted
	(C) <i style="color: red;">sunspots</i> appear <i style="color: red;">		although</i> never sighted
	(D) <i style="color: red;">sunspots</i> appear, <i style="color: red;">		although</i> never having been sighted
	(E) <i style="color: red;">sunspots</i> appear, <i style="color: red;">		which</i> have never been sighted
			</pre>
			<p>The answers all use parallel structure (the words in grey text are verbs that apply to the subject <i style="color: blue;">sunspots</i>), but the structure changes in the middle. It's acceptable to use a coordinating conjunction (<i style="color: blue;">but</i>) to connect the two halves because both verbs, <i style="color: blue;">are visible</i> and <i style="color: blue;">have been sighted</i>, have the same subject, <i style="color: blue;">sunspots</i>. Consider this structurally similar example: She likes milk but never drinks it.</p>
			<p>It's not okay, however, to use a subordinating conjunction (<i style="color: red;">although</i>) in this situation because a subordinating conjunction requires a clause (its own subject and verb). Consider this example: She likes milk <i style="color: red;">although</i> she never drinks it. Answers (C) and (D) don't provide a subject after the word although. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) uses the relative pronoun which, <i style="color: red;">which</i> is a noun modifier. This modifier should refer to the closest main noun that precedes it. The sentence reads: <i style="color: red;">Sunspots appear as dark spots, which have never been sighted</i>. How can something appear and yet never be sighted? This same mistake was also made in answer (B). Eliminate answer (E)</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (A) uses a parallel structure with an appropriate conjunction to connect the two halves of the sentence. It also clearly conveys the idea that the sunspots are visible sometimes, but not at the poles or equator.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Parallelism: <i>creating</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence appears to contain a list of three things with a faulty structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	The NAS has urged the nation to revamp, institute, creating.
			</pre>
			<p>While it might be tempting to say that the sentence is only making the first two verbs (<i style="color: red;">revamp, institute</i>) parallel, this is impossible because the sentence would need to include the word <i style="color: red;">and</i>: <i style="color: green;">revamp and institute</i>. That portion of the sentence isn't underlined, so it can't be changed. The sentence, then, must be providing a list of three things (<i style="color: green;">X, Y, and Z</i>), but the word <i style="color: blue;">and</i> is missing before the third item. Also, that third item (<i style="color: red;">creating</i>) is not parallel to the first two (<i style="color: red;">revamp</i>, <i style="color: red;">institute</i>). Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (C) for faulty parallel structure.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>takes</i></b><br>
			<b>Idiom: <i>for taking</i></b></p>
			<p>The idiom at the end of the sentence changes from choice to choice:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) an organization <i style="color: green;">to take</i> charge
	(B) an organization <i style="color: red;">that takes</i> charge
	(C) an organization <i style="color: red;">for taking</i> charge
	(D) an organization <i style="color: red;">for taking</i> charge
	(E) an organization <i style="color: green;">to take</i> charge
			</pre>
			<p>The intended meaning is this: create an organization in order to <i style="color: blue;">take charge</i> of something. The idiom <i style="color: green;">to take charge</i> is acceptable. The idiom <i style="color: red;">for taking charge</i> is incorrect. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>Answer (B) is more subtle. The sentence says that the National Academy of Sciences has urged the nation to act. This answer choice specifically calls for a new organization that takes charge of something. But <i style="color: red;">takes</i> is a present tense verb, implying that the organization already does take charge.That doesn't make any sense! Eliminate answer (B) for illogical meaning.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (E) fixes the initial parallel structure error by inserting the word <i style="color: green;">and</i>. It also ensures that the third item, <i style="color: green;">create</i>, is parallel to the first two.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>A pioneer journalist</i></b></p>
			<p>An opening modifier should refer to the main subject after the comma.</p>
			<p>In the original sentence, <i style="color: red;">the pioneer journalist</i> refers to <i style="color: red;">Nellie Bly's exploits</i>, not <i style="color: green;">Nellie Bly</i> herself. The other answers change the structure around, so you can't reuse this particular reason to eliminate; do examine the other answers for similar structural or modifier issues, though. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>The remaining answers are so dissimilar that you'll simply have to read each one. Answer (C) reads:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color:red;">(C) Nellie Bly was a journalist including in her exploits the circling the globe faster than Fogg.</span>
			</pre>
			<p>Technically, there should be a comma just before the word <i style="color: red;">including</i>, but commas are sometimes judgment calls. Luckily, there's a bigger issue: sentence structure. At the very least, the sentence would need to say <i style="color: red;">the circling of the globe</i>. Eliminate answer (C) for faulty structure.</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>are</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (D) contains an inverted sentence structure: the subject appears after the verb. Here's the sentence flipped around the “right” way:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color:red;">(D) Circling the globe faster than Fogg are included in Bly's exploits.</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The subject is actually the word <i style="color: blue;">circling</i>. Gerunds (-ing words functioning as nouns) are singular, so the verb should be <i style="color: green;">is</i>, not <i style="color: red;">are</i>.</p>
			<p>Note: The official explanation states that <i style="color: red;">are</i> should be in past tense, but it is possible to say that, today, a list of Bly's exploits includes (present tense) this incident of circling the globe. The subject–verb mismatch is a stronger reason to eliminate answer (D).</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: the journalist's exploits of Bly</b></p>
			<p>Answers (A) through (D) make clear that <i style="color: blue;">Bly</i> is the <i style="color: green;">journalist</i>. Answer (E) talks about <i style="color: red;">the journalist's exploits of Bly</i>.</p>
			<p>Is Bly also the journalist? Or is a journalist describing or discussing Bly? If it's the latter, then who circled the globe faster than Fogg: the journalist or Bly? Eliminate answer (E) for unacceptable ambiguity in meaning.</p>

			<p><b>Verb / Meaning: <i>doubled</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence talks about <i style="color: blue;">intensifying expectations that</i> something <i style="color: red;">more than doubled</i>.</p>
			<p>You have expectations for the future, not for the past. It's illogical to say that the retail sales patterns are intensifying expectations that something already happened in the past. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>

			<p><b>Comparison: <i>that of</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence makes a comparison: <i style="color: blue;">personal spending in one quarter more than doubled <i style="color: red;">that of</i> the growth rate in personal spending in the previous quarter</i>. What does <i style="color: red;">that of</i> refer to?</p>
			<p>Both logic and parallelism dictate that the phrase <i style="color: red;">that of</i> refers to <i style="color: blue;">personal spending</i>. The original sentence, then, reads <i style="color: blue;">personal spending in one quarter more than doubled personal spending of the growth rate in personal spending in the previous quarter.

			<p>Consider this example: The company's sales rose, intensifying expectations of success, that it would increase.</p>
			<p>If the portion after the last comma (<i style="color: red;">it would increase</i>) is an independent clause, then it should be connected to the rest of the sentence by a coordinating conjunction (such as <i style="color: green;">and</i>).

			<p><b>Meaning: <i>nothing; and</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence describes <i style="color: blue;">foods that do not contain additives, preservatives, or nothing that has been synthesized</i>. Shorten the sentence: <i style="color: red;">foods that do not contain nothing that has been synthesized</i>.</p>
			<p>Both <i style="color: red;">do not</i> and <i style="color: red;">nothing</i> are negatives. It's not acceptable to use two negatives in a row; this is called a double negative and it's always wrong. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>
			<p>Check the and versus or issue that you spotted when comparing the answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	do not contain additives, preservatives, or anything synthesized 
	do not contain additives, preservatives, and anything synthesized
			</pre>
			<p>The <i style="color: red;">and</i> option means that the food cannot contain all three bad things at once—but a food that has only one or two of the three would still be considered <i style="color: blue;">natural</i>.

			<p><b>Parallelism: X, Y, or that Z</b></p>

			<p>Option 1 is a list of three items, but the third is not parallel to the first two. In option 2, the sentence contains two parallel <i style="color: blue;">that</i> clauses: <i style="color: blue;">that do not contain</i> and <i style="color: blue;">that has been</i>. In this case, the first portion would have to be <i style="color: red;">that do not contain X or Y</i>. The word <i style="color: red;">or</i> is missing!

			<p><b>Modifier: <i>in the form of</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence contains the prepositional phrase <i style="color: blue;">in the form of carbon dioxide</i>. What is this phrase modifying?</p>
			<p>Prepositional phrase modifiers are flexible. They can modify nouns (in which case, they should be placed as close to the noun as possible) or they can modify the main clause to which they're attached.</p>
			<p>Check the text before the modifier to find an acceptable noun or adverbial modifier structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

	(D) Plants, more efficient than fungi at acquiring <span style="color:green;">carbon</span>, in… 
	(E) Plants acquire carbon more efficiently than <span style="color:red;">fungi</span>, in…
			</pre>
			<p>Note: <i style="color: blue;">plants</i> and <i style="color: blue;">fungi</i> are two categories of organisms. An example of a fungus (fungi and funguses are both acceptable plural forms of fungus) is a mushroom.</p>
			<p>Logically, the <i style="color: green;">carbon</i> is found <i style="color: green;">in the form of carbon dioxide</i>. In answers (A) and (B), if the phrase is a noun modifier, then it must be modifying the closest noun, <i style="color: red;">fungi</i>. If the phrase is an adverbial modifier, then it must be modifying the sentence core: <i style="color: red;">plants are more efficient</i>. Either way, the phrase is not modifying carbon. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison / Idiom: <i>as contrasted with X, Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the comparison idiom <i style="color: red;">as contrasted with X, Y</i>. This is not a valid construction.</p>
			<p>Eliminate answer (A) and check the other answers. <i style="color: green;">In contrast to X, Y</i> is an acceptable comparison idiom, as is <i style="color: green;">unlike X, Y</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison / Parallelism: <i>in contrast to X, Y; unlike X, Y</i></b></p>
			<p>Any comparison requires the X and Y portions to be parallel; the words must be structurally similar and logically comparable. The Y portion must be <i style="color: green;">yellow jacket</i> (it's not underlined). Examine the X portions of the answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) <span style="color:green;">the honeybee</span> 
	(B) <span style="color:red;">the honeybee's</span> 
	(C)<span style="color:red;"> the sting</span> of the honeybee 
	(D) <span style="color:red;">that</span> of the honeybee 
	(E) <span style="color:green;">the honeybee</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The honeybee is logically comparable to the yellow jacket; answers (A) and (E) are acceptable.</p>
			<p>In answer (C), the <i style="color: red;">sting</i> of an insect is not logically comparable to <i style="color: green;">yellow jacket</i>. In answer (D), the X portion is <i style="color: red;">that</i>. It's not necessary to determine the antecedent for this pronoun. The word <i style="color: red;">that</i> must be referring to something other than <i style="color: green;">the honeybee</i>—the sentence can't say <i style="color: red;">the honeybee of the honeybee</i>—so <i style="color: red;">that</i> cannot be logically comparable to <i style="color: green;">yellow jacket</i>.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) is tricky. The apostrophe-s structure signals a possessive noun, so some unknown main noun is implied to follow <i style="color: red;">honeybee's</i>. As with answer (D), this choice can't say <i style="color: red;">the honeybee's honeybee</i>, so the main noun (whatever it is) can't be parallel to <i style="color: green;">yellow jacket</i>.

		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>The sentence begins with a subject (<i style="color: blue;">Neuroscientists</i>), followed immediately by a modifier, and finally the verb (<i style="color: blue;">are</i>). The underline extends to this point, so check the remaining answers for the subject–verb core of the sentence:</p>

	(E) Neuroscientists have amassed, (modifiers), <span style="color: green;">now drawing</span>
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A), (D), and (E) all contain a subject–verb core: Neuroscientists are drawing or neuroscientists have amassed. Answers (B) and (C), though, use the structure Neuroscientists, and are. The structure and are indicates a second main verb—but where is the first one? Consider this example: The university, and announced. The structure is not a complete sentence. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Meaning: <i>now</i></b></p>
			<p>While examining the Structure issue above, you might spot another issue with answers (D) and (E). The modifier <i style="color: blue;">now drawing</i> changes the time frame. <i style="color: blue;">Have amassed</i> is present perfect, but <i style="color: blue;">now</i> is simple present.</p>
			<p>Normally, a “comma -ing” modifier takes on the time frame of the main clause: The university has amassed a strong reputation, drawing on the expertise of its professors. The <i style="color: blue;">drawing</i> on action takes place in the same time frame as the has amassed action. Try to change the time frame: The university has amassed a strong reputation, and is now drawing on the expertise of its professors to further cement its status.</p>
			<p>It would be necessary to insert a new clause: <i style="color: green;">and is now drawing</i>. Answers (D) and (E) don't do this. Eliminate both for faulty structure.</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>over the past twenty years</i></b></p>
			<p>The modifier <i style="color: green;">over the past twenty years</i> moves around in the answer choices.</p>
			<p>A time frame modifier should be clearly attached to one particular action: what happened <i style="color: green;">over the past twenty years</i>?</p>
			<p>The <i style="color: green;">neuroscientists amassed knowledge over</i> the twenty-year period.

			<p>The sentence contains a very unusual structure: two semicolons! When you read the original sentence, pay attention to the overall meaning; this will help you to determine how these semicolons are used.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

			</pre>
			<p>The sentence contains a list of three roles played by the <i style="color: blue;">tropical bats</i>. The first one, <i style="color: green;">aiding</i>, is not underlined, so the other two have to match. In answer (A), the third item is not parallel to the first two. Eliminate answer (A).</p>

<div class="round-box">

	Correct answer (B) is the only one to offer a parallel structure: <i style="color: green;">aiding; pollinating; and helping.</i> <br>
	It is possible (though unusual) to use semicolons to separate items in a list. This sentence probably used that structure because two of the items on the list also contained lists themselves; using only commas would have been confusing.<br> 
	Note: The test writers did not actually test you on this issue. All five of the answers used the semicolons.

			<p><b>Meaning: organism's trying</b><br>
			<b>Idiom: trying that</b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence contains the construction <i style="color: red;">the organism's trying to metabolize.</i></p>
			<p>The official test writers typically reject this construction (<i style="color: red;">organism's trying</i>, a possessive noun followed by gerund) as awkward, but it is not necessarily always wrong. At least one official Sentence Correction question does contain this type of construction in the correct answer.</p>
			<p>What to do? If another choice offers a regular noun (not a gerund) and is otherwise correct, choose the regular noun over the gerund. In this case, three answers do offer the construction the <i style="color: green;">organism's attempt</i>. Set answer (A) aside until you have examined those other answers; if a choice using <i style="color: green;">attempt</i> is also otherwise correct (as is the case in this problem), then eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Answer (B) also uses <i style="color: red;">organism's trying</i>, but this answer actually crosses the line into an outright error. <i style="color: red;">Trying that it</i> do something is idiomatically incorrect; the proper structure is <i style="color: green;">trying to do</i> something. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: attempt to try</b><br>
			<b>Meaning / Structure: try and metabolize</b></p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (D) use the structure <i style="color: red;">attempt to try</i>, while answer (E) says <i style="color: green;">attempt to metabolize</i>.</p>
			<p>An <i style="color: blue;">attempt</i> already means <i style="color: blue;">to try</i> to do something, so it is redundant to say <i style="color: red;">attempt to try</i>. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>Answer (D) also introduces a meaning error with the structure <i style="color: red;">try and metabolize</i> (rather than <i style="color: green;">try to metabolize</i>). Consider this example: She attempted to meet her friends for only an hour and study afterwards, but her plan failed. The use of the word “and” separates the two actions: she attempted to meet her friends and, separately, she attempted to study. In the given problem, the separation would mean that the <i style="color: red;">organism attempted to try something</i> <i style="color: blue;">and</i> (separately) <i style="color: red;">attempted to metabolize something</i>—but then the sentence fails to say what the organism is trying to do. Common sense indicates that the organism is <i style="color: green;">trying to metabolize</i> something, so don't separate the two actions with the word <i style="color: red;">and</i>.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b> Meaning / Modifier: outnumbering</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence structure is complex:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	The letters were written over a period beginning X and ending Y, outnumbering her letters to anyone else.
			</pre>
			<p>A <i style="color: darkorchid;">“comma -ing”</i> modifier refers to the main subject and verb of the sentence. In this case, the sentence says that the fact that the letters were written <i style="color: red;">over a long period</i> resulted in those letters <i style="color: red;">outnumbering</i> her letters to others. This is nonsensical; it's possible to write 3 letters spaced over a long period or 3,000. Eliminate answer (A) for an illogical meaning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb / Parallelism / Structure</b></p>
			<p>Following from Issue (1) above, answers (C) and (D) also use <i style="color: red;">outnumbering</i> but both place an <i style="color: red;">and</i> beforehand, altering the sentence structure. Given the long and complex sentence structure in general, examine the overall structure of the remaining answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) The letters were written over a period that begins X and ended Y, outnumber her letters to anyone else.
	(C) The letters, written over a period beginning X and that ends Y and outnumbering her letters to anyone else.
	(D) The letters, which were written over a period beginning X, ending Y, and outnumbering Z. <i>(Note: Parallel structure dictates a list of three things in this choice!) </i>
	(E) The letters, which were written over a period beginning X and ending Y, outnumber her letters to anyone else.
			</pre><p/>
			<p>Stripping the answers down to the core reveals quite a bit. First, the sentence structure contains some parallelism (<i style="color: blue;">X and Y</i>). Answer (B) pairs an earlier action in present tense (<i style="color: red;">begins</i>) with a later action in past tense (<i style="color: red;">ended</i>). The <i style="color: red;">period</i> can't begin in the present and end in the past. Answer (C) violates parallelism by using <i style="color: red;">beginning</i> and <i style="color: red;">that ends</i>. Eliminate answer (B) for an illogical meaning and answer (C) for faulty parallelism.</p>
			<p>Further, in answer (B), the <i style="color: red;">outnumber</i> portion of the sentence is no longer constructed as a modifier. If <i style="color: red;">outnumber</i> is meant to be part of the core, though, then a coordinating conjunction is needed: <i style="color: green;">the letters were written and outnumber</i>. Answer (B) can also be eliminated for bad structure.</p>
			<p>Answer (C) lacks a main verb entirely—everything following the word <i style="color: blue;">written</i> is part of a modifier. Answer (D) has the same error—everything after <i style="color: red;">which</i> is part of a modifier. Eliminate answers (C) and (D) because they are sentence fragments.</p>
		</li>

<div class="round-box">

	Correct answer (E) fixes the initial modifier / meaning error by making <i style="color: green;">outnumber</i> the main verb: <i style="color: green;">The letters outnumber her letters to anyone else</i>. The information in between is introduced as a <i style="color: green;">which</i> modifier and the X and Y portions (beginning and ending) are parallel.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Comparison: <i>unlike X, Y</i></p>
			<p><i>Unlike</i> = comparison! When <i>unlike</i> is at the beginning of the sentence, the structure will usually be Unlike <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>…so the next step is to find the <i>X</i> and the <i>Y</i>. In this case, <i>X</i> is <i>the conviction</i> and <i>Y</i> is <i>Barbara McClintock</i>.</p>
			<p>Comparisons are supposed to be logically comparable—that is, the two things should be similar types of things—but a person and a non-person are definitely not similar. How could this be fixed?</p>
			<p>Notice that <i>the conviction</i> is underlined, while <i>Barbara McClintock</i> is not; you're stuck with Barbara, then, and need to change the other half of the comparison to a person or people. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Idiom: <i>of the conviction of; convinced of genes being; being convinced</i></p>
			<p>The original sentence doesn't contain any errors beyond the comparison error. What to do? Try a vertical comparison of the answers to spot differences that might help point to specific errors. The  ends of the five answer choices show a split between <i>that genes were</i> and <i>of genes being</i>.</p>
			<p> Take a look at answer (B) first; it attempts to use the idiom <i>to be of the conviction that</i>, but incorrectly finishes off the idiom with the word <i>of</i> rather than <i>that</i>. Further, the word <i>being</i> here is incorrect; the sentence requires a regular verb construction (such as <i>that genes were</i>). Either reason is good enough to eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p> Answers (C), (D), and (E) change the noun <i>conviction</i> to the verb <i>convinced</i>. How does this change the idiom? Someone can be convinced <i>that genes were</i> something (convinced + that + subject + verb), or someone can be convinced <i>of the simplicity of</i> a noun (convinced + of + noun or noun phrase, but not a verb). In all three remaining answers, the sentence tries to use a subject + verb after the word <i>that</i>, so the correct construction must be <i>convinced that</i>.

			<p>The sentence employs a comparison structure:<i>Phenomena would appear the same to someone</i> (in one position) <i>as a person</i> (in another position).</p>
			<p>Although it might seem like the structure <i>the same to X as Y</i> is parallel, it isn't. The correct structure is <i>the same to X as to Y</i>. The other answers correctly insert the word <i>to</i> before the <i>Y</i> portion. Eliminate answer (A).</p>

			<p>In answers both (C) and (E), the portion before the semicolon is an independent clause. Here are the portions after the semicolon:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (D) use the pronoun <i>it</i>. Which noun goes with this pronoun?</p>
			<p>Parallelism dictates that <i>it would</i> reflects the earlier sentence structure <i>phenomena would</i>. This next part is tricky: <i>Phenomena</i> is plural. Phenomenon is the singular form. A singular pronoun can't refer to a plural noun; eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>

			<p>The first three answers compare <i>someone</i> to <i>a person</i>. The final two answers compare <i>someone</i> to <i>the person</i> . What's the difference?</p>

			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) Because an oversupply has sent prices plunging, 
	(B) Because of plunging prices, which is due to an oversupply,
			</pre>
			<p>Answer (B) splits the wording into two modifiers. The <i>which</i> modifier refers to the main noun in the preceding text, <i>plunging prices</i>. This noun, though, is plural, while the modifier uses the singular verb <i>is</i>. The modifier can't refer to <i>chips</i> either, because <i>chips</i> is also plural. Mismatch! Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>which</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (C)'s structure is similar to that of (B), so examine (C) next.</p>
			<p>Once again, check for the referent of the <i>which</i> modifier.</p>
			<p>In this sentence, <i>plunging</i> is a verb, so the <i>which</i> portion must refer to the noun <i>prices</i>—but note that, this time, <i>prices</i> refers to the original prices, not the lowered prices! The original prices didn't result from an oversupply. The <i>plunging prices</i> were the problem. Eliminate answer (C) for bad meaning.</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>due to</i></b></p>

	(D) Due to plunging prices from an oversupply, 
	(E) Due to an oversupply, with the result that prices have been sent plunging,
			</pre>
			<p><i>Due to X</i> modifies a noun. For example: Her high score was due to diligent study. “Due to diligent study” modifies “high score.” In the problem, an oversupply leads to plunging prices, so a correct construction might be something such as <i>the plunging prices were due to an oversupply</i>. In answer (D), though, the <i>due to</i> construction modifies the noun<i>manufacturer</i>. The <i>manufacturer</i> was not <i>due to plunging prices</i>; this is nonsensical. Likewise, in answer (E), neither the original <i>prices</i> nor the <i>manufacturer</i> was <i>due to an oversupply</i>. (Note: It's not okay to say that the fact that <i>the manufacturer will cut production</i> was <i>due to plunging prices</i>—then, <i>due to</i> would modify a clause, not a noun.)

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>depends on if; whether or not; ability for</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the incorrect construction <i>depends on if</i>.</p>
			<p>It's possible to use <i>depends on</i> whether it can or <i>depends on</i> its ability to. The phrase <i>whether or not</i> is common in speech but is considered redundant because the word <i>whether</i> already means whether or not. Eliminate answers (A) and (C) for incorrect idiom usage.</p>
			<p>Note the last two answers, which use the form <i>depends on its / the ability</i>. The correct idiom to continue this structure is <i>ability to</i> do something. Answer (D) uses the incorrect idiom <i>ability for</i>. Note that answer (E) might appear to make the same error, but <i>to broaden</i> does appear later in the sentence. Eliminate answer (D) for incorrect idiom usage.</p>

	(C) it has the capability to broaden and can leave
	(D) its ability for broadening and leaving

			</pre>
			<p>All are parallel on the surface but one has a problematic structure and one a problematic meaning. Answer (C) is similar to answers (A) and (B) but broadens the parallelism: <i>has the capability to broaden</i> and <i>can leave</i>. From a technical standpoint, nothing is wrong with answer (C). The parallel structure <i>broaden</i> and <i>leave</i>, though, is much simpler than the structure <i>has the capability to broaden</i> and <i>can leave</i>. The parallel structure in answers (A) and (B) is cleaner, and at least one, answer (B), does not have any other errors or problems. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) introduces a Meaning issue. The <i>ability</i> in question is the museum's ability, logically, so it should be expressed as such with a possessive. The phrase <i>the ability for it</i> should therefore be replaced by <i>its ability</i>. Eliminate answer (E).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence discusses <i>a time when aviation was still so new for many of the planes</i>. Compare that to this example: The concept was so new for many of the students that they struggled to understand.</p>
			<p>The structure <i>X is new for Y</i> implies that <i>Y</i> is having the new experience. The students are learning a new concept. Are the planes just learning about or experiencing aviation for the first time? That meaning is nonsensical. Eliminate answers (A) and (B) for implying that <i>the planes</i> found <i>aviation new</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>where; in which</i></b></p>
			<p>The answers differ in the way that they introduce the time frame: <i>at a time when</i>, <i>at a time that</i>, <i>at a time where</i>, or <i>at a time in which</i>.</p>
			<p>The word <i>when</i> is perfectly appropriate when discussing a time frame. It's also acceptable to say <i>at a time that</i> (though <i>when</i> would probably be preferred in this sentence). The word <i>where</i>, though, refers to a location not a time frame. It's also inappropriate to say <i>at a time in which</i> (though perhaps <i>at a time during which</i> could work).

		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>so X such that Y were Z</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (D) uses the construction <i>so new such that many planes were of experimental design</i>.</p>
			<p>This choice mixes two idioms. It's possible to say that<i>aviation was so new that many planes were of experimental design</i> ( <i>so X that many Y were Z</i>). It's also possible to say that the history of aviation was such that planes were still dangerously new (<i>X such that Y</i>). It's not correct, though, to jumble the two together.

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>like it is; as if</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the idiomatic structure <i>sales figures seem like it is indicative</i>. What is this portion of the sentence trying to convey?</p>
			<p>Consider this example: His test result seems like it is indicative of intelligence. At the most basic level, it would be necessary to use the idiom <i>seems as though</i>, not <i>seems like</i> (although people do speak that way in casual speech). Eliminate answer (A) for using an incorrect idiom.</p>
			<p>Likewise, in answer (B), it would be necessary to say that <i>the sales figures seem as though</i> they are something or have some characteristic, not <i>as if</i>. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it</i></b></p>
			<p>While examining the idiom issue, you might also spot the pronoun problem: <i>sales figures seem like it is indicative</i>. What is <i>it</i>?</p>
			<p>The pronoun <i>it</i> refers back to <i>sales figures</i>—but <i>it</i> is singular and <i>figures</i> is plural. (It's also a bit clunky to say that <i> the sales figures seem like the sales figures are indicative that X </i> . Why repeat the term <i>sales figures</i> as a pronoun?) Eliminate answer (A) for a bad pronoun match.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>The final clause is introduced in one of three ways:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) it is indicative that the economy is not nearing a recession 
	(B) as if to indicate the economy is not nearing a recession 
	(C) to indicate that the economy is not nearing a recession 
	(D) indicative of the economy is not nearing a recession 
	(E) an indication of the economy is not nearing a recession
			</pre>
			<p>Let's slightly change the example used during the discussion of the Idiom issue: His test result seems like it is indicative of he is intelligent. In the original example, it was appropriate to use the preposition <i style="color: blue;">of</i> because only a noun followed: <i style="color: blue;">indicative of intelligence</i>. In this new example, though, a clause follows: <i style="color: blue;">he is intelligent</i>. The preposition <i style="color: red;">of</i> cannot be followed by a clause. Eliminate answers (D) and (E) for a faulty sentence structure.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) also makes an error in structure. <i style="color: red;">To indicate</i> can be followed by just a noun (his test results seem to indicate intelligence) or by a clause. When followed by a clause, it's preferable to insert the word <i style="color: blue;">that</i>: his test results seem to indicate that he is intelligent. While there is some debate in the real world as to when the word <i style="color: green;">that</i> is required, the GMAT test writers have not yet published a question in which the correct answer does not insert the word <i style="color: green;">that</i> before the clause in a similar setup.

			<p><b>Parallelism / Meaning: while being; discharged; injured</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence provides a list of three things relating to Deborah Sampson; other answers change this structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) Sampson joined, was injured, and was discharged 
	(B) Sampson joined, was injured, while being discharged 
	(C) Sampson joined and was injured, and discharged 
	(D) Sampson joined, injured, and was discharged 
	(E) Sampson joined, having been injured and discharged
			</pre>
			<p>The original <i>X, Y, and Z</i> list is correctly constructed. Answer (B) changes the list to what appears to be two items followed by a modifier ( <i>while being discharged</i>); this introduces two problems. First, a two-item list still needs an <i>and</i> between the two items: <i>Sampson joined and was injured</i>. Answer (B) is missing the <i>and</i>. Second, the sentence now indicates that Sampson was in the midst of being discharged on all three (separate) occasions when she was injured. The meaning is nonsensical. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>Answer (C) also changes the structure: <i>Sampson joined and was injured, and discharged</i>. Aside from the fact that it's wordy to use <i>and</i> twice, <i>Sampson</i> didn't discharge herself from the army; she <i>was discharged</i>. Answer (D) contains a similar error:<i>Sampson joined, Sampson injured, and Sampson was discharged</i>. Sampson <i>was injured</i>. Eliminate answers (C) and (D) for illogical meanings in the parallel portion of the sentence.</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>having been</i> </b></p>
			<p>Answer (E) changes the parallel structure so substantially that it deserves a separate discussion. <i>Sampson joined in 1782, having been injured and discharged in 1783</i> .</p>
			<p>Consider this example: Riga joined the company in March, having been offered a substantial raise. When was she offered the raise and when did she join the company? “Comma -ing” modifiers pick up the time frame of the main verb in the sentence (in this case, the past tense <i>joined</i>). In this case, Riga either had already been offered the raise or was offered the raise pretty much at the moment she joined.</p>
			<p>Likewise, in answer (E), the <i>having been</i> actions should take place before or in the same time frame as the <i>joined</i> action. This is impossible, though, because Sampson joined in 1782 but wasn't injured or discharged until 1783. Consider this: Riga joined the company in March, having been offered a promotion three months later in June. That's nonsensical! Eliminate answer (E) for an illogical meaning.</p>

			</pre>
			<p> Answer (A) is incorrect due to a lack of parallelism between the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> elements: either both portions should begin with a preposition (<i>as</i>) or neither should. Further, the word <i>also</i> is redundant in the construction <i>X and also Y</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (E) are setting a very tricky trap.

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>but</i></b></p>
			<p>Strip the original sentence down to its core structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	OPEC had been expected to announce X, but officials announced that the group will do X, but only if Y.
			</pre>
			<p>The double use of the “comma but” structure should raise an alarm bell. The first instance is used correctly to introduce a new independent clause. In the second instance, the words <i>but only</i> are redundant; it is sufficient to say that <i>the group will do X only if Y</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Verb: <i>were; would be</i></p>
			<p>The verb tense changes from choice to choice:<i>were to trim, is trimmed, would be trimmed, were trimming</i>, or <i>trim</i>.</p>
			<p><i>The group will only pare production if</i> some other countries first reduce output, so this reduction in output could not have occurred yet. It's inappropriate, then, to use past tense for this portion of the sentence. Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
			<p>It's also inappropriate to use the hypothetical <i>would be trimmed</i> . The <i>officials announced</i> an intention to do a certain thing <i>if non-OPEC nations trim output</i>. This intention is not hypothetical. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>is trimmed; would be trimmed</i></b></p>
			<p>For a portion of the sentence, the answers switch from active to passive voice: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) if non-OPEC nations were to trim output 
	(B) if the output is trimmed 
	(C) if the output would be trimmed 
	(D) if non-OPEC nations were trimming output 
	(E) if non-OPEC nations trim output
			</pre>
			<p>This issue is very subtle. Although many people prefer active voice to passive voice, passive voice is grammatically correct; don't eliminate just for this reason. Do, though, examine the meaning.</p>
			<p>The meaning of the original sentence is that OPEC will do <i>X</i> if nations agree to reduce output. In other words, the organization first wants these nations to agree to take a certain action themselves. The active construction <i>if nations trim output</i> conveys this meaning. By contrast, the passive construction <i>if the output is trimmed</i> does not indicate who is responsible for trimming the output. The nations themselves are no longer the ones who must agree to do so; perhaps the international community or OPEC will force the countries to do so. Eliminate answers (B) and (C) for introducing this ambiguity in who performs the action.</p>

			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) read: <i>Lucretia Mott published her Discourse on Women, arguing in a treatise </i> …What does this mean? Is <i>Discourse on Women</i> the <i>treatise</i>? Or is the treatise something else?</p>
			<p>If <i>Discourse on Women</i> is the treatise, then there is no need to include the phrase <i>in a treatise</i>; the <i>arguing</i> action described refers to the entire previous clause, which includes <i>Discourse on Women</i>. If, on the other hand, the <i>treatise</i> is a different piece of work, then the sentence is confusing; why is the modifier talking about something other than what was discussed in the main clause? Eliminate answers (A) and (B) for creating this problem! </p>
			<p>Note that answers (C), (D), and (E) fix this problem by placing<i>a treatise</i> immediately after the comma. In these choices, <i>a treatise</i> is a straight noun modifier, referring to the noun just before the comma in a manner similar to this construction: She likes Rover, the basset hound that Luciano bought.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>advocate X and for Y</i> </b></p>
			<p><b>Structure / Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The sentence contains a parallel structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) arguing for women to have rights and for changes
	(B) arguing for equal rights and for changes
	(C) that advocates equal rights and for changes
	(D) advocating equal rights and for changes
	(E) argued for equal rights and for changes

			<p>Tackle the most obvious mismatch first: answers (C) and (D) use the structure <i>advocates X and for Y</i>. The second parallel item should be <i>changes</i>, not <i>for changes</i>. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>Superficially, the other three are fine, but the structure in answer (A) is not quite right. The treatise argues for two things: <i>equal rights</i> and <i>changes</i>. Pretend someone's reading answer (A) aloud: <i>arguing in a treatise for women</i>…(pause) <i>…to have rights</i>. The treatise was written for women? The treatise was intended to be read by women? The treatise wants women to have rights? Who knows! In order to eliminate this potential ambiguity in meaning, say either (1) <i>a treatise</i> argues <i>for equal rights</i> (<i>for</i> + noun), or (2) <i>a treatise</i> argues <i>that</i> women should have <i>equal rights</i> (<i>that</i> + clause).

			<p><b>Verb / Meaning: <i>have</i></b></p>
			<p>The first split in the answers is between the simple present tense <i>have to know</i> and the conditional <i>would have to know</i>.</p>
			<p>The sentence discusses a hypothetical situation: the demographers currently don't know the information that they <i>would</i> need to know in order to make certain forecasts. In this case, use the conditional <i>would have to know</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B) for using a tense that does not convey this conditional meaning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Comparison: <i>X more than Y</i></p>
			<p>The underline contains a comparison marker, <i>X more than Y</i>. When you spot a comparison, check the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions to make sure that they are logically comparable—that is, the two things should be similar things.</p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the <i>X</i> portion is what the demographers <i>would have to know</i> and the <i>Y</i> portion is <i>now</i>. These two things aren't comparable; the proper comparison is between what they <i>would have to know</i> and what they actually <i>do know</i>. Note: This trap was set specifically for native speakers, who will typically understand what the sentence is trying to convey and overlook the fact that the comparison itself is not exact. Eliminate answers (A) and (E) for an illogical comparison.</p>

			<p><b>Meaning: <i>economical</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (A), (D), and (E) end with the word <i>economic</i>. Answers (B) and (C) use <i>economical</i>. These two words do not mean the same thing! </p>
			<p><i>Economic</i> refers to the economy; <i>economic determinants</i> is a synonym for business factors.<i>Economical</i>, on the other hand, can relate to the economy but more commonly means “in a frugal or cost-effective manner.”<i>Economical determinants</i>, then, means <i>cost-effective determinants</i>. The word <i>cost-effective</i> is illogical in this context. The sentence is trying to discuss the social and business factors that affect fertility. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence indicates that Laos's <i>land area</i> is <i>about the same as Great Britain</i>. It's illogical to compare the land area of a country to an actual country—compare either land area to land area or country to country.</p>
			<p>Scan the other answers for the same issue. Answer (B) also compares Laos's <i>land area</i> to <i>Great Britain</i> . Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
			<p>Answer (D) compares Laos's <i>land area</i> to Great Britain's<i>size</i>. While this comparison can technically be made, <i>size</i> is a more vague term—it could refer to area, yes, but also to other things, such as population. Be suspicious of this answer.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>where</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains a modifier beginning with the word <i>where</i>; this modifier provides information about the characteristics of members of the <i>population</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Population</i> is not a location; it's inappropriate to refer to <i>population</i> using a modifier that starts with the word <i>where</i>. Eliminate answer (A). None of the other answers repeat this error.</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier / Meaning: <i>many</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence talks about <i>many</i> who <i>are members of hill tribes</i>. <i>Many</i> what? People, presumably—but the modifier specifically refers to the population. The sentence essentially says that <i>many populations are members of hill tribes</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Populations</i> aren't <i>members</i> of anything; individuals are. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (D) for implying that the <i>populations</i> are <i>members of the hill tribes</i>.</p>

			<pre class="compare-group">
	(C) … , but in Laos with a population of only four million people, many of them are members.
			</pre>
			<p>The conjunction <i>but</i> can introduce a new clause, and <i>many of them are members</i> is a clause, so that works. It is also acceptable to say <i>in Laos, many of them are members</i> (as long as the sentence contains an antecedent somewhere for <i>them</i>). The problem in (C) lies with the pronoun, <i>them</i>, and the placement of the antecedent, <i>people</i>. Consider the meaning of this example: In a country with too many people, overcrowding is common. It's evident that the overcrowding results from there being too many people in the country.</p>
			<p>In answer (C), the implication is that because <i>Laos has four million people</i>, <i>many of them are members of hill tribes</i>. This cause-effect relationship doesn't make sense. Eliminate answer (C).</p>

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b>
			<b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the word <i>and</i>. What is it trying to make parallel? The parallel structure appears to be this: <i>Much energy was expended for the creation and when they constructed</i>.</p>
			<p>The writer is setting a trap. Superficially, the sentence might sound fine, but the construction is not actually parallel because the<i>X</i> portion is a simple phrase (<i>creation of images</i>) and the <i>Y</i> portion is a full clause (<i>they constructed</i>). Answer (C) contains a similar error: <i>Energy was expended on the creation as well as constructing</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) switch up the subject of the sentence, also changing the parallel structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(D) creating images accounted for energy and also constructing and decorating  
	(E)  the creation of images accounted for energy as well as construction and decoration
			</pre>
			<p>In both cases, the sentence says that the<i>creation of images accounted for</i> two things: <i>energy</i>, and <i>construction and decoration</i>. This is illogical; the <i>creation of images</i> did not account for the <i>construction and decoration of the temples</i>. Rather, the <i>artisans’ energy was expended on</i> these things. Eliminate answers (D) and (E) for illogical meaning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>for</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the words <i>energy was expended for</i> .</p>
			<p>When explaining how the energy was used, the correct idiom is the <i>energy was expended on</i> something. Answers (B) and (C) both fix this error. Answers (D) and (E) use a different construction entirely. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>It can also be correct to say something such as this: The battery's energy was <i>expended for</i> the good of science. However, the meaning of this example is very different from the intended meaning of the original sentence. This alternate example explains why the energy was expended; the original sentence explains how the energy was expended.</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>they</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence includes the pronoun <i>they</i>. What is its antecedent?</p>
			<p>Logically, the pronoun <i>they</i> should refer to the noun <i>artisans</i> —the <i>artisans</i> are the ones who <i>constructed the temples</i>. The word <i>artisans</i>, though, is not a noun in this sentence; instead, the word <i>artisans’</i> is an adjective, in the same way that the word cat's is an adjective in the phrase the cat's toy. Whose <i>energy</i>? The <i>artisans’ energy</i>. Whose toy? The cat's toy.</p>
			<p>This leaves the plural noun <i>images</i> to match with the word <i>they</i>, but that match is illogical. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>

		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence starts with an independent clause (<i>Pope began…Iliad</i>) and follows it up with a modifier ( <i>a work that</i>). The modifier has a confusing structure:</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><img align="middle" src="../../../assets/img/question/OG15-SC-47.png"/><p>
			<p>Essentially, the sentence says <i> Pope began his translation of the Iliad, a work that and that Johnson pronounced </i>. In the structure <i>a work that X and that Y</i>, there is no <i>X</i> portion at all.</p>
			<p>Answer (A) is definitely wrong. Eliminate (A).</p>
			<p>Check the other answers to see how they handle this construction:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) a work that took 		and that Johnson pronounced 
	(C) a work that had taken 	and that Johnson pronounced it as 
	(D) a work that took 		and that Johnson pronounced it as 
	(E) a work that had taken 	and Johnson pronounced it
			</pre>
			<p>On the surface, all of the remaining choices appear to be parallel. There is one problem though. The words <i>a work</i>, which appear before the parallelism starts, must apply to both the <i>X</i> and<i>Y</i> portions of the sentence. Try this with answer (B): <i>a work that took and (a work) that Johnson pronounced</i>. No problem. Now try answer (C): <i>a work that had taken and (a work) that Johnson pronounced it</i>.What is <i>it</i>?</p>
			<p><i>It</i> is the work! Answer (C) really reads <i>a work that Johnson pronounced the work</i>. This is redundant, if not downright illogical. Answers (C), (D), and (E) all contain this error, so eliminate them.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had taken</i></b></p>
			<p>Some answers say that <i>the work took seven years to complete</i>; others say <i>the work had taken seven years to complete</i>. Are both versions acceptable?</p>
			<p>Pope began his translation in 1713. The completion happened after that, so the past perfect can't be used in that sense. The sentence also talks about another past event: <i>Johnson pronounced</i>. It's possible that Johnson made his pronouncement well after the work was done, in which case <i>the completion</i> might properly be written in the past perfect. Johnson, though, was Pope's contemporary; he might have made the pronouncement before the work was even fully completed. Because the sequence of events isn't clear, and either possibility is reasonable, it's better to keep the two actions in simple past. Eliminate answers (C) and (E).</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The first three answer choices talk about a <i>translation of the Iliad</i> . The final two change the noun <i>translation</i> to a verb:<i>Pope began translating the Iliad</i>. Recall that a noun modifier ( <i>a work that</i>) follows.</p>
			<p>In answers (D) and (E), <i>a work</i> must refer to <i>the Iliad</i>, because <i>translating</i> is not a noun. Pope did not create <i>the Iliad</i> itself, however; he created a <i>translation of the Iliad</i>. The modifier is also clearly talking about the <i>translation</i>, not the original work, because Johnson pronounced Pope's work <i>the greatest translation</i>. Eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>

			<p>If the <i>which</i> modifier does refer to <i>the Earth</i>, then the meaning is illogical; the Earth isn't four times the size of a lake on the Earth. If, on the other hand, the <i>which</i> modifier refers to <i>the largest lake</i>, the meaning is logical, but the structure is odd. <i>The largest lake</i> refers to <i>the Caspian</i>, so why not use the simpler and completely unambiguous structure <i>the Caspian is the largest lake and covers</i>? Eliminate answer (A) for creating this dilemma in the first place.</p>
			<p>When one meaning issue due to modifier placement exists, look for similar issues in the other answers. The word <i>actually</i>, an adverb, moves around the sentence. What does it modify? In this case, the <i>Caspian</i> is <i>called a sea</i> but it is <i>actually the largest lake</i>. Answer (B) places <i>actually</i> with the <i>landlocked Caspian</i>, not <i>the largest lake</i>. Eliminate it.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>Answer (D) begins with the word <i>though</i>, signaling a subordinate clause. Such opening modifiers can either be complete sentences (Though he studied all night, he still failed his test the next day) or non- clause modifiers (Though tired, she studied for another hour).</p>
			<p>In answer (D), the opening subordinate clause offers both a non-clause modifier (<i>called a sea</i>) and a complete sentence ( <i>it actually is the largest lake</i>). This isn't allowed—the sentence should either say something along the lines of <i>though called a sea but actually the largest lake on Earth</i> (two non- clause modifiers) or <i>though it is called a sea, it is actually the largest lake on Earth</i> (two clauses). Eliminate answer (D) for faulty structure.</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The meaning issue in answer (E) is very subtle; this one is tough to spot.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	Despite being called a sea, the largest lake …is actually the Caspian.
			</pre>
			<p>Consider this example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	Despite being called a pie, the best cake in the store is actually the chocolate dessert.
			</pre>
			<p>Think about how you would convey that same meaning in a sentence yourself. Perhaps you'd say something similar to this: Despite being called a pie, that chocolate dessert right there is actually a cake. The contrast is between pie and cake, the two possible types of dessert. The example sentence above, though, appears to contrast the category pie and one specific chocolate dessert. Simplify the faulty example even more:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color:green;">Despite being called a pie, it is actually the chocolate dessert.</span>
	<span style="color:red;">Despite being called a sea, it is actually the Caspian.</span>
			</pre>
			<p>This structure doesn't offer a logical contrast. The sentence should say something such as <i style="color: green;">despite being called a sea, it is actually a lake</i>. Eliminate answer (E) for an illogical meaning.</p>

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>of assembling</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the idiom <i>the required time of assembling</i>.</p>
			<p>The correct idiom is <i>the time required to</i> do something, or <i>time required + infinitive</i>. In this case, the sentence should read <i>the time to assemble</i> or <i>the time required to assemble</i>. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>being</i></b></p>
			<p><i>Being</i> gets its own category because it's so very odd. In this case, answers (B) and (C) both use <i>the time being required</i>.</p>
			<p>As a general guideline, if you can remove the word <i>being</i> and the sentence is still structurally correct and makes sense, then do so. Because both answers (B) and (C) could correctly say<i>the time required</i> (the exact same structure without the word <i>being</i>), the insertion of the word <i>being</i> is unnecessary.</p>
			<p>Note that when used correctly, <i>being</i> most often indicates either an ongoing action in the passive voice or a characteristic of something; neither is the case here. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>down to; X to Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The answers differ slightly in the way that they present the portion <i>from a day and a half to 93 minutes</i>. Answer (B) inserts extra meaning with <i>down to 93 minutes</i>. Answer (C) omits the word <i>from</i>.</p>
			<p>The non-underlined portion of the sentence already indicates that the time has been <i>reduced</i>. Further, <i>from</i> a longer time frame <i>to</i> a shorter one reinforces the idea that the time has gone down. It's redundant, then, to add the word <i>down</i>. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>The sentence is trying to convey a change: <i>from X</i> (one time frame) <i>to Y</i> (another time frame). The structure <i>X to Y</i> does not convey the same meaning, so eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>Strip out the <i>which</i> modifier (along with both of its commas) and examine answer (E):</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	The system reduced from a day and a half to 93 minutes, the time required for the assembling of a Model T.
			</pre>
			<p>Why is that comma there? The test writers are hoping you fall into the trap of thinking that there is also a comma between reduced and from, like this: <i>the system reduced, from X to Y, the time required</i>. That would be okay—but it's not what answer (E) says.</p>
			<p>With only the one comma, though, the portion before the comma should now be able to stand alone as its own sentence, while the portion after the comma would be a modifier. <i>The system reduced from a day and a half to 93 minutes</i>. What did it reduce? Itself? The core of the sentence no longer makes sense. Eliminate answer (E).</p>

			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A), (E): confidence that the economy will avoid 
	(B), (C), (D): confidence in the economy (‘s ability) to avoid
			</pre>
			<p>It is possible to use either <i>confidence that</i> or <i>confidence in</i> correctly in a sentence, as long as you follow some rules. Someone has <i>confidence in</i> a noun: She has confidence in your ability. Alternately, someone has <i>confidence that</i> something more complex will occur: She has confidence that you will get a good score on the GMAT. In the given answers, the more complex structure exists, so use <i>confidence that</i>, not <i>confidence in</i>. Eliminate answers (B), (C), and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>what</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (B) changes the restrictive modifier <i>that many had feared</i> into a non-restrictive modifier (set off by commas) beginning with the word <i>what</i>.</p>
			<p><i>What</i> and <i>that</i> are not interchangeable; <i>what</i> is not a regular relative pronoun and can't be used to start this kind of noun modifier. None of the other answers repeats this error, so eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>		
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Meaning: <i>X rather Y; X with Y</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (B) and (E) change the structure so that the sentence no longer contains the <i>X and Y</i> parallelism marker:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) in the economy to avoid X rather to come in for Y 
	(E) the economy will avoid X with it instead coming in for Y
			</pre>
			<p>The word <i>rather</i> is an adverb, not a conjunction (such as <i>and</i>), so <i>to come in for Y</i> is never properly connected to the rest of the sentence. This is the equivalent of saying <i>confidence in the economy to avoid X, to come in for Y</i>. Note that <i>rather</i> is not the same thing as <i>rather than</i>.</p>
			<p>In answer (E), the prepositional phrase <i>with it coming</i> does not clearly convey the idea that <i>the economy will avoid X and instead do Y</i>. Further, the wording seems to indicate that the economy is definitely <i>coming in for a “soft landing”</i> already, where the original sentence says merely that there is growing confidence that this will occur. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) changes the placement of <i>earlier in the year</i>:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	the recession, something earlier in the year many had feared
			</pre>
			<p>Placing <i>earlier in the year</i> right after <i>something</i> makes it sound like <i>something</i> (in this case, <i>the recession</i>) actually happened then. Rather, the action that occurred <i>earlier in the year</i> was the fear:<i>Many had feared</i> that something would happen <i>earlier in the year</i>. The recession itself did not actually occur, though. Eliminate answer (C) for a confusing meaning.</p>

<div class="round-box">

		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>ability for</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the clause<i>it hampers the ability for distinguishing</i>. The correct idiom is <i>ability to</i> do something, not <i>ability for</i> doing something. If you don't spot the error on your initial read-through, you have a second chance when comparing the answers; some use <i>ability for</i> while others use <i>ability to</i>.</p>
			<p>Eliminate answers (A) and (E) for using the incorrect idiom <i>ability for</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The ends of the answer choices differ. All begin with the same lead-in words:</p>
			<p><i>hampers the ability of some children</i> … </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) for distinguishing X 	and, the result is, to make Y 
	(B) to distinguish X 		and, as a result, to make Y 
	(C) to distinguish X 		and, the result of this, they are unable to make Y  
	(D) to distinguish X 		and results in not making Y 
	(E) for distinguishing X 	resulting in being unable to make Y
			</pre>
			<p>
			The meaning of the original sentence is illogical. The sentence is structured as two different clauses, each with its own subject and verb. The first clause asserts that the brisk pace of life hampers kids’ ability to distinguish sounds. The second clause indicates that as a result, the kids can make sense of speech. Think about what that means. Shouldn't the opposite be true? If they have trouble distinguishing sounds, that should make it harder for them to make sense of speech, not easier. Eliminate answer (A) for an illogical meaning.
			This reasoning would seem to mean that you should eliminate answer (B) as well because the two answers look fairly similar. Be careful! Don't fall into the trap. In answer (B), the parallel structure allows you to apply the verb <i>hampers</i> to the last part of the sentence:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	It hampers the ability of some children to distinguish sounds and, as a result, to make sense of speech .
			</pre>
			<p>Both <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are hampered. Answer (B) is okay. What about the remaining answers?</p>
			<p>Answer (C) is similar to (A) in construction, but the subject is missing a verb: <i>The result of this</i> [is that] <i>they are unable to make sense of speech</i>. Eliminate answer (C) for containing a subject without a matching verb.</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) change the ending structure more substantially. In both cases, the <i>results</i> portion is no longer talking about the children. In answer (D), the wording <i>and</i> [it] <i>results in not making sense of speech</i> conveys only that someone is not making sense of speech, but who? Perhaps it's the case that adults can't make sense of the children's speech.</p>
			<p>In answer (E), the “comma -ing” modifier <i>resulting</i> refers to the main subject and verb: <i>the pace of life may be so brisk</i>. Again, this fails to convey who is now <i>unable to make sense of speech</i>. Eliminate both (D) and (E) for ambiguous meaning.</p>

	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) fixes the original error by changing the clause <i style="color: red;">the result is</i> to the modifier <i style="color: green;">as a result</i>, and by ensuring that parallelism allows the verb <i style="color: green;">hampers</i> to apply to both described actions: <i><span style="color:green;">hampers the ability to distinguish sounds and</span></i> [hampers the ability] <i><span style="color:green;">to make sense of speech</span></i>.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>to Josephine Baker; for Josephine Baker</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence begins with a short opening modifier, <i>to Josephine Baker</i>. Answer (B) has a similar structure, but answer (C) changes the structure to make <i>Baker</i> the subject of the sentence. In answers (D) and (E), the sentence is back to starting with an opening modifier. Check both modifier placement and meaning.</p>
			<p>In order for a sentence to start with a modifier such as <i>to Josephine Baker</i> or <i>for Josephine Baker</i>, the main clause has to be something that is true <i>to</i> or <i>for Baker</i>. Consider this example: To Josephine, olives tasted too salty. You can flip that sentence around: Olives tasted too salty to Josephine.</p>
			<p>Can you do this with the original sentence? <i>To Josephine, Paris was her home</i>. Paris was her home to Josephine. The sentence seems to say that someone else's Paris home felt like home to Josephine. The sentence should say <i>To Josephine, Paris was home</i> (Paris was home to Josephine). The same problem exists with the construction <i>for Josephine Baker</i>; eliminate answers (A) and (B) for ambiguous meaning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>to be; being</i> </b></p>
			<p>The answers differ in the way that they present this portion of the sentence:</p>

	(E) before it was fashionable being an expatriate
			</pre>
			<p><i>Fashionable to be</i> is an acceptable idiom, but <i>fashionable being</i> is not. In order to move the verb <i>to be</i> earlier in the sentence, as in answer (C), you would have to say <i>before being an expatriate was fashionable</i> (and that construction would probably still be considered awkward).

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Parallelism: <i>X and also Y; X and Y</i></p>
			<p>The first difference is a split between <i>a critique</i> and <i>critiquing</i>. What's the difference between the two forms?</p>
			<p>The original sentence offered two commentaries about the “Essay on Heat and Light”: It was <i>a critique</i> of something <i>as well as a vision</i> of something else. The two pieces, then, should be parallel: <i>X as well as Y</i> or (in other choices) <i>X and Y</i>. Check all of the answers for parallelism:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) a critique 	as well as a vision 
	(B) a critique 	and also his envisioning 
	(C) a critique 	and envisioning 
	(D) critiquing 	and also a vision 
	(E) critiquing 	as well as his own envisioning
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (B), (C), and (D) are definitely not parallel; eliminate them. Answer (E) does have two -ing words, so it's parallel on the surface, but this one needs to be examined more closely.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>When examining the choices for Parallelism, you might pick up on an ambiguous Meaning issue in answer (E). The sentence could be read to mean <i>critiquing X as well as Y</i>; that is, Davy <i>critiqued</i> two things, rather than <i>critiquing</i> one thing and <i>envisioning</i> another.</p>
			<p>Technically, you don't have to know which meaning Davy really intended; this isn't a history test. It's enough to eliminate answer (E) because it's not clear whether the sentence is trying to say that he critiqued one thing and envisioned something else or that he critiqued two things. Eliminate answer (E) for an ambiguous meaning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>his</i></b></p>
			<p>This issue is probably the hardest to spot, but you might have noticed the use of the pronoun <i>his</i> when examining answer (E) for the Meaning issue. Does <i>his</i> refer to <i>Boyle</i> or to <i>Davy</i>?</p>
			<p>Answers (B) and (E) use the pronoun <i>his</i> after the mention of both <i>Davy</i> and <i>Boyle</i>. In either answer choice, it's entirely possible for the pronoun to refer to either man. Eliminate both answers (B) and (E) for ambiguity.</p>

	Correct answer (A) conveys the needed meaning in a parallel and unambiguous manner. Note that some people might eliminate answer (A) because <i>all chemistry since Robert Boyle</i> can sound awkward. It is not actually incorrect, though.

			<p><b>Meaning: <i>to be able</i></b></p>
			<p>The issue in the original sentence is tough to spot because the sentence is so wordy, but look closely at the extract below:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	rent-to-buy programs that enable a family…to be able to move
			</pre>
			<p>The verb <i>enable</i> means the same thing as the phrase <i>to be able to</i>; using both words is redundant.</p>
			<p>Answers (B), (C), and (D) strip out the <i>to be able</i> language and correctly say that the <i>programs enable a family to move</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (E) for redundant language.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) introduces a semicolon after the word <i>programs</i>. The first portion is a complete sentence. What about the second portion?</p>
			<p>The second portion of the sentence is problematic, but, interestingly, it can be considered a complete sentence. The word <i>that</i> refers back to the entire first clause (the portion before the semicolon), and it is actually logical to say that because builders offer these rent-to-buy programs, families are enabled to move into new housing.</p>
			<p>The end of the sentence, though, tacks on a comma followed by <i>to apply</i>. How does this structure relate to the rest of the sentence? It's unclear. The parallelism marker <i>and</i> has been removed, and the only thing in its place is a comma, which doesn't indicate how <i>to apply</i> matches up with the rest of the sentence.

			<p>Answer (D) says <i>programs, which enables</i>; answer (E) says <i>programs, which enable</i>. Does the sentence need a singular or plural verb?</p>
			<p>A <i>which</i> modifier typically refers to the main noun immediately preceding the comma—in this case, <i>programs</i>. The plural <i>programs</i> should match with the plural verb <i>enable</i>. Eliminate answer (D) for a subject–verb mismatch.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>Empire, fashioned</i> </b></p>
			<p>The structure <i>Empire, fashioned</i> (a comma followed by an -ed word) is a big noun-modifier clue; the information after the comma, the modifier, should refer to the closest main noun before the comma. In this case, that noun is <i>empire</i>. An entire empire was fashioned from sandstone? Maybe the buildings, but not the empire itself; that's illogical.</p>
			<p>If the empire was not fashioned from sandstone or schist, what was? The images. Eliminate answer (A) and scan the remaining choices. Answers (B) and (C) repeat this error so they can be eliminated.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>either X or Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The word <i>either</i> is always paired with the word <i>or</i> in the structure <i>either X or Y</i>. In addition, the <i>X</i> and the <i>Y</i> have to be parallel.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) either from sandstone 		or schist 
	(B) either sandstone 			or from schist 
	(C) either fashioned from sandstone 	or schist 
	(D) either fashioned from sandstone 	or from schist 
	(E) either from sandstone 		or from schist
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) all break parallelism. Only answer (E) provides <i>from</i> + <i>noun</i> for both <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.
			Answer (E) is not the only way to make <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> parallel. The authors could have written:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	fashioned from either sandstone or schist
			</pre>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verbs: <i>fashioned</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) both correct the original modifier error by inserting the word <i>and</i> after the word <i>Empire</i> . This creates a second main verb and a parallel structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(D) Many of the images date from X and fashioned from Y.
	(E) Many of the images date from X and were fashioned from Y.
			</pre>
			<p>The subject is <i>many of the images.</i> Did these images themselves perform the action of fashioning something? Or were they fashioned by someone or from something? The images didn't fashion anything; rather, they <i>were fashioned from</i> one of two substances. The sentence requires the passive <i>were fashioned</i>. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
			<p>Note that the correct answer is in passive voice. Based upon the meaning of the sentence, active voice would be illogical. Don't cross off passive voice simply because it's passive!</p>

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (E) fixes both original errors. The insertion of the word <i>and</i> after <i>Empire</i> corrects the original modifier error:<i>Many of the images date</i> (from a certain time)<i>and were fashioned</i> (from one of two materials). The structure <i>either X (from sandstone) or Y (from schist)</i> is parallel.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>can hardly be said</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses an unusual construction: <i>That</i> [ <i>X is true</i>] <i>can hardly be said that it is Y</i>. The correct idiomatic structure is <i>that</i> [<i>X is true</i>] <i>can hardly be said to be Y</i>.</p>
			<p>(Note: <i>Can hardly be said</i> means that the thing is not true—these people are not at fault.) Eliminate answer (A) for using the incorrect idiom. Answer (B) does use the correct idiom. Answer (E) is missing the ending portion of the idiom: <i>to be Y</i>. Answers (C) and (D) use a different structure, <i>it can hardly be said that</i>; the idiom is used correctly in both of those answers. Eliminate answers (A) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>When examining the Idiom issue, you may have noticed some related Meaning issues. In answer (B), while the idiom itself is correct, the meaning of the <i>Y</i> portion is illogical:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	That educators have not (done something) can hardly be said to be at fault.
			</pre>
			<p>Who is not at fault? Technically, this sentence says that <i>the fact that</i> the educators didn't anticipate something is <i>not at fault</i>.</p>
			<p>The meaning of answer (B) is illogical. The <i>educators</i> are the ones who are <i>not at fault</i>. Answer (E) also contains an illogical meaning: <i>the fact that educators are at fault</i> indicates that these people really are in the wrong. However, this doesn't match the information after the colon; the sentence should say that the educators are not really at fault. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
			<p>In answer (C), the clause <i>it is the fault of educators who</i> introduces an ambiguous meaning. The <i>who</i> modifier simply defines which educators are under discussion. The sentence essentially says:<i>it is</i> [<i>not</i>] <i>the fault of</i> those particular <i>educators</i>. What is not their fault? The pronoun <i>it</i> can't refer to the descriptive modifier, so now the reader doesn't know what <i>it</i> is. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the original idiom error by using a different construction: <i>it can hardly be said that educators are at fault for</i> something. This meaning, <i>the educators</i> are not <i>at fault</i>, agrees with the meaning of the example given after the colon.

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>a leading figure</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence begins with an opening noun modifier: <i>a leading figure</i>. This text should modify the subject after the comma. In the construction <i>Adam Smith's books</i>, <i>Smith's</i> is not a noun; it's an adjective describing the <i>books</i>, which are the subject of the sentence.</p>
			<p>It's illogical to say that <i>the books</i> were <i>a leading figure</i>; rather, <i>Adam Smith</i> was <i>a leading figure</i>. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (C) for an illogical match between the modifier and the noun.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>X is to Y like A is to B; X is to Y just as A is to B; X is to Y similar to A is to B</i> </b></p>
			<p>The problem uses an unusual comparison idiom that changes a bit in the five answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) Smith's books are to democratic capitalism <span style="color: green;">what</span> Marx's book is to socialism 
	(B) Smith's books are to democratic capitalism <span style="color: red;">like</span> Marx's book is to socialism

	(D) books are to democratic capitalism <span style="color: red;">similar to</span> Marx's book is to socialism 
	(E) books are to democratic capitalism <span style="color: green;">what</span> Marx's book is to socialism
			</pre>
			<p>What does this comparison idiom mean? Here's a simpler example: McDonald's is to the fast food industry what Coke is to the soft drink industry. The sentence is saying that McDonald's and Coke play similar roles in their respective industries.</p>
			<p>Similarly, the given problem is saying that Smith's books and Marx's book play similar roles in their respective forms of government. The correct structure to use is <i>X is to Y what A is to B</i>. Eliminate answers (B), (C), and (D) for using an incorrect word in place of the word <i>what</i>.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>festival's month</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence indicates that the <i>truce</i> took place <i>during the festival's month</i>. Other answer choices use the wording <i>the festival month</i> or <i>the month of the festival</i>.</p>
			<p>The possessive apostrophe-s is used when the possessive word owns or possesses the following noun, as in the example <i>Jun's car</i>. Jun possesses the car.</p>
			<p>In the given sentence, does the festival possess the month? Consider this example: April is spring's month. This is incorrect because spring does not actually possess the month. In this problem, the <i>festival</i> does not actually possess the <i>month</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>proclaiming</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (B) introduces a “comma -ing” modifier: <i>proclaiming a truce</i>. This kind of construction modifies the main subject and verb, in this case, <i>the Olympic Games helped to keep peace</i>.</p>
			<p>The “-ing” form <i>proclaiming</i> refers to someone or something performing an action. But who performed that action? Did the Greek world proclaim a truce? Did the people proclaim a truce? Did the Olympic Games organizers proclaim a truce? Eliminate answer (B) for an ambiguous meaning</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>they</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) introduces a pronoun: <i>they proclaimed a truce</i>. Who <i>proclaimed the truce</i>?</p>
			<p>The sentence contains two plural nouns: <i>the Olympic Games</i> and <i>the pugnacious states</i>. The subject pronoun <i>they</i> appears to refer to the subject <i>Olympic Games</i>. Consider this example: The cars were stolen when they were left unlocked. Structurally, the words “when they” point right back to the original subject.</p>
			<p>In the given problem, though, this meaning would be illogical—the <i>Games</i> themselves can't proclaim something. Only the <i>states</i> would work logically, but structurally, the pronoun <i>they</i> seems to point to the <i>Games</i>. Eliminate answer (C) for ambiguity.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>Some answers indicate that the truce took place <i>during</i> the relevant month; others say that the truce was <i>for</i> the relevant month. Are both variations acceptable?</p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (E) both say that <i>the truce</i> [<i>was</i>] <i>for</i> the given time frame. Technically, this means that the truce was in favor of the time frame. Consider this example: Alan was for the new law. This would mean that Alan approved of the new law (i.e., he wanted to see it pass or succeed). This <i>for</i> construction doesn't convey the same meaning as <i>for the duration of</i> or <i>during</i>, the intended meaning of the sentence. Eliminate answers (C) and (E) for conveying an illogical meaning.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the original error by removing the possessive and using <i>the month of the festival</i>. This answer also makes clear that the truce lasted <i>during</i> the relevant month. Notice that the correct answer contains two independent clauses,<i>The Olympic games helped to keep peace</i> and <i>a sacred truce was proclaimed</i>, joined by a comma and the coordinating conjunction <i>for</i>. The correct answer would be a run-on sentence if that <i>for</i> weren't there.

			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>determines</i></b></p>
			<p>The subject of the main clause is <i>the predominating industries and the regulatory environment</i>.</p>
			<p>This plural subject needs a plural verb, but the corresponding verb in the original sentence is the singular <i>determines</i>.</p>
			<p>Note that both the subject and verb are underlined, so you'll need to check both in the other answers. It turns out that every answer uses the same plural subject, but the verb switches back and forth between <i>determines</i> and <i>determine</i>. Eliminate answers (A), (C), and (D) for using the singular <i>determines</i> with a plural subject.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>their</i></b></p>
			<p>While checking the subjects, you may have noticed that some answers say <i>their industries</i> instead of <i>the industries</i> . Check the pronoun.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) uses <i>their</i> incorrectly. The plural pronoun needs to point to a plural noun, but <i>each state</i> is singular. Answer (C) also uses <i>their</i>, but this time the pronoun correctly points to the plural <i>all states</i>. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) contains a semicolon; always check for proper usage whenever you see a semicolon.</p>
			<p>This punctuation mark can be used only if the part before is a complete sentence and the part after is a complete sentence.</p>
			<p>In this case, the portion of the sentence that appears before the semicolon ( <i>while all states face a similar industrial waste problem</i>) is not a complete sentence. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>This issue is pretty subtle; you might not spot it. The sentence is attempting to contrast two things: <i>while all states</i> are alike in a certain way, <i>each state</i> differs in another way.</p>
			<p>This contrast is made more clear if the <i>states</i> are lumped together, plural, when discussing the way in which they're alike, and separated out ( <i>each state</i>) when discussing the way in which they're different. It's not necessarily incorrect to write this in a different way, but notice that the correct answer is written this way.</p>
			<p>Answers (A), (C), and (E) appropriately talk about <i>all states</i> when discussing the similarity. Answers (B) and (D), though, use <i>each state</i>. Answer (D) further confuses things by using <i>each state</i> a second time, during the portion of the sentence discussing the differences. The two halves of the sentence describe a contrast; using <i>each state</i> twice, though, makes the two halves seem more similar. Eliminate answer (D) for introducing ambiguity and put a question mark next to answer (B) for using <i>each state</i> where <i>all states</i> would be more clear.</p>

</div>
<div class="round-box">

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning</b></p>
			<p>The sentence contains a lot of modifiers; the placement of some modifiers in answers (B) and (C) confuse the meaning.</p>
			<p>In answer (B), the pronoun <i>it</i> refers to the <i>army</i>, so that the sentence reads: <i> an army that was created by artisans who took 36 years to complete the army </i> .

			<p>The sequence of modifiers in answer (C) is confusing:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

			</pre>
			<p>What happened <i>more than 2,000 years ago</i>? The army was <i>created</i>. The <i>warriors</i> didn't just appear, nor were they <i>protected</i> 2,000 years ago. The modifier should more clearly point to the action that occurred <i>more than 2,000 years ago</i>. Further, the placement interrupts another noun and modifier pair: <i> the warriors (more than 2,000 years ago) that would protect Qin Shi Huang </i> . The two halves not in parentheses should be right next to each other;<i>the warriors</i>, not some <i>years ago</i>, are the ones who <i>would protect Huang</i>.</p>

			<p>Although people will use <i>try and establish</i> in casual conversation all the time, the meaning is still illogical. The test writers are trying to get you to fall for false parallelism, but the sentence shouldn't have a parallel structure here.</p>
			<p>Answer (C) is suspect; <i>establishing</i> might be okay, but the construction in answers (D) and (E) (<i>try to establish</i>) is better. Put a question mark next to answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>establish restrictions for</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the idiom <i>establish restrictions for</i> the amount of something. The correct idiom is to <i>establish restrictions on</i> the amount or usage of something.</p>
			<p>Eliminate answers (A) and (C) because they use the incorrect idiom <i>establish restrictions for</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence also contains a real instance of the parallelism marker <i>X and Y</i>: </p>

	(B) will try and establish 	and encouraging 
	(C) will try establishing 	and to encourage 
	(D) will try to establish 	and encouraging 
	(E) will try to establish 	and to encourage
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) use the form <i>will establish</i> for the <i>X</i> portion. Neither <i>to encourage</i> nor <i>encouraging</i> is an acceptable match for the <i>Y</i> portion. Answers (C) and (D) pair a participle with an infinitive; both are not parallel. Only answer (E) offers a parallel structure: <i>to establish and to encourage</i>. Eliminate answers (A), (B), (C), and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>able to be</i>; <i>capable of being</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (A), (C), and (E) indicate that the government is trying to restrict what some people will be <i>allowed to grow</i>. Answer (B) talks about what is <i>able to be grown</i> and answer (D) talks about what is <i>capable of being grown</i>. Are all versions acceptable?</p>
			<p><i>Allowed</i> means permitted: the government permits the farmers to grow a certain amount of grain. What farmers are <i>able to grow</i> or <i>capable of growing</i> is a different issue. One farmer might be <i>able to grow</i> more than the restrictions would allow while another farmer might be <i>capable of growing</i> less than the restrictions allow. The government can't determine this; it just depends how much land a farmer has, how good she is at growing grain, and so on. Eliminate answers (B) and (D) for an illogical meaning.</p>

	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (E) fixes the original meaning issue by using the construction <i>will try to establish</i>. It also offers the parallel construction <i>to establish and to encourage</i>.

			<p>The idiom <i>not only X but also Y</i> means that the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions go in the same direction. In other words, these <i>factors do damage</i> and <i>aggravate genetic predispositions</i>. Answers (B) and (C) unacceptably change the meaning of the sentence by using the idiom <i>X but also Y</i>. <i>But</i> is a contrast: She likes ice cream but hates chocolate. The <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions no longer go in the same direction. Answer (D) is wrong for a similar reason. The <i>X</i> portion starts with <i>not only</i> but the <i>Y</i> portion doesn't start with any idiom marker at all. Eliminate answers (B), (C), and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>aggravating</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the verb <i>aggravate</i>. The other answer choices use the form <i>aggravating</i>.</p>
			<p><i>To aggravate</i> means to cause something to get worse. The adjective <i>aggravating</i>, on the other hand, is most commonly used to mean irritating or annoying. In a sentence structure such as <i>the factors are aggravating</i>, it can be difficult to tell whether <i>aggravating</i> is used as a verb (causing something to get worse) or as an adjective (irritating, in the colloquial usage). Such ambiguity is bad and the GMAT writers prefer to avoid this construction. Eliminate answers (B), (C), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>doing</i> </b></p>
			<p>Answer (E) uses the present progressive verb <i>doing</i> rather than the simple present <i>do</i>.</p>
			<p>The sentence is trying to convey a general “truth”: these three factors <i>do damage</i>. <i>Are doing damage</i> implies that the three factors are only having this effect at this very moment (rather than in general).</p>

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>digging in sediments</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence begins with an opening “comma -ing” modifier: <i>digging in sediments in northern China</i>. The main noun following this structure should indicate who or what was <i>digging</i>— but it's illogical to say that the <i>evidence</i> was <i>digging</i>.</p>
			<p>Because the underline starts with the word <i>evidence</i>, scan the beginning of each answer. There are only two options: <i>evidence</i> (definitely wrong) and <i>scientists</i>. The word <i>scientists</i> is acceptable: the <i>scientists</i> were <i>digging</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>suggesting</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains <i>suggesting</i> as an ambiguous modifier: <i>evidence has been gathered by scientists suggesting that</i>. Is the evidence suggesting something or are the scientists suggesting something?</p>
			<p>When an “-ing” word functioning as a modifier isn't separated out by a comma, then that modifier typically modifies the noun right before it; this modifier may or may not have anything to do with other nouns in the sentence. Consider this example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	Evidence has been gathered by people living in France.
			</pre>
			<p>The evidence isn't living in France; the people are. The evidence isn't even necessarily being collected in France; these people live in France, but they might be collecting evidence in Indonesia. Similarly, the original sentence implies that the <i>evidence</i> was collected by <i>scientists</i> who also happen to be <i>suggesting</i> a separate theory about something else. This is theoretically possible but not very logical.</p>
			<p>It would be more logical, then, to say that the <i>evidence suggests</i> (or indicates) something. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>that which; that</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence makes a comparison between what the new evidence suggests and what was previously thought to be true. Some of the comparisons include a pronoun structure (<i>that</i> or <i>that which</i>).</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) life-forms emerged 	earlier than they had previously thought 
	(B) earlier emergence 	than had been previously thought 
	(C) life-forms emerged 	earlier than previously thought 
	(D) earlier emergence 	than that which was previously thought 
	(E) earlier emergence 	than that previously thought
			</pre>
			<p>The structure is pretty complex. The comparison signal is <i>earlier than</i>, but what is the actual comparison? Here's where the difficulty comes in: these answers all imply something for the second half that was already stated in the first half. It's possible to say that something <i>emerged</i> (verb) earlier than it was previously thought to <i>have emerged</i> (an implied verb). It's also possible to say that the <i>emergence</i> of something <i>occurred</i> earlier than it was previously thought to <i>have occurred</i> (another implied verb). In both cases, the implied verb is explicitly used in the first half of the comparison. Parallelism allows you to assume that the verb repeats in the second half.</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) mess up the comparison by introducing an unneeded pronoun: <i>that</i>. This pronoun seems to refer to <i>emergence</i>, but if you substitute <i>emergence</i> in place of <i>that</i>, the illogic of the comparison becomes apparent, as in the case of (D):<i>earlier emergence</i>…than <i>the emergence which was previously thought</i>. This substitution implies that there were two separate emergences. However, there was only one emergence, one that simply happened earlier <i>than previously thought</i>. Choice (E) also inserts the word <i>that</i>; eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the opening modifier error by making <i>scientists</i> the subject of the sentence. This choice also correctly indicates that the <i>evidence</i> is <i>suggesting</i> something and the comparison structure is parallel: <i>life-forms emerged earlier than</i> [ <i>they were</i>] <i>previously thought</i> [<i>to have emerged</i>].

			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence contains this parallel structure:</p>
			<p>(A), (B), (C): <i>a breakwater that would rise and act</i> (D), (E): <i>a breakwater that would rise and acting</i> The form <i>act</i> is parallel to <i>rise</i>; <i>acting</i> is not. Eliminate answers (D) and (E) for breaking parallelism.</p>

			<p><b>Meaning: <i>act like; acting like</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (A), (C), and (D) use the idiom <i>act(ing) as a buffer</i>. Answers (B) and (E) use <i>act(ing) like</i>. Are both acceptable?</p>
			<p>It is possible to use both <i>act as</i> and <i>act like</i> correctly in a sentence, but the two mean different things. <i>Act as</i> is used when something performs a certain function: Her GMAT book acts as the perfect sleep aid (because she falls asleep whenever she starts to study!). <i>Act like</i>, on the other hand, describes  how someone behaves: He acts like a jerk sometimes, but he's actually a nice guy.

			<p><b>Meaning: <i>growing</i></b></p>
			<p>Three answer choices contain the comma followed by <i>which</i>, the other two change to “comma -ing.” Does the sentence require a noun modifier or an adverbial modifier?</p>
			<p>What <i>can grow</i> or is <i>growing</i>? The <i>killer whale</i>. Because the noun <i>killer whale</i> already appears right before the comma, the sentence should use a noun modifier (<i>which</i>) after the comma. The adverbial modifier, <i>growing</i>, would modify the verb <i>include</i>, implying that the killer whale is <i>growing</i> as a result of the fact that the <i>32 species include</i> them. This is illogical. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>as big as</i></b></p>
			<p>The five answers differ in their description of the whale's possible length: (A) <i>can grow to be 30 feet long</i></p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) growing as big as 30 feet long
	(C) growing up to 30 feet long
	(D) can grow as big as 30 feet long
	(E) can grow to be 30 feet long
			</pre>
			<p>It is acceptable to say that something grows <i>to be 30 feet long</i> or <i>up to 30 feet long</i>. The third variation, however, is the wrong word choice (and redundant besides). It's incorrect to use <i>as big as</i> for a length; rather, use <i>as long as</i>. However, even if the correct idiom had been used, this would make the full phrase <i>as long as 30 feet long</i>, which is redundant. Eliminate answers (B) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>includes</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (C) start with the plural verb <i>include</i>; answers (D) and (E) begin with the singular <i>includes</i>. Which is correct?</p>
			<p>Find the subject. The subject is not <i>whales</i>, nor is it the <i>dolphin family</i>. The subject is all the way at the beginning: <i>species</i>. This word is a little tricky, because the singular and plural versions are identical. Two clues indicate that <i>species</i> is plural in this sentence: the number <i>32</i> and the double-verb structure. The sentence reads: <i>The 32 species are X and include Y</i>.

		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>outlining his strategy</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains a classic opening modifier structure: <i>Outlining his strategy, the executive's plans were announced</i>. When the underline includes any portion of an opening modifier or the main clause that follows an opening modifier, check the structure.</p>
			<p>Such opening modifiers must refer to the subject right after the comma, but <i>the plans</i> didn't develop a <i>strategy</i>. The <i>executive</i> did. (Note that the pronoun <i>his</i> also can't refer to the <i>plans</i>!) Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>plans for cutting</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence talks about the <i>plans for cutting the debt</i>.</p>
			<p>First, note that the word <i>plans</i> is a noun in this sentence, not a verb. It is possible to talk about <i>the plans for</i> a noun: the plans for the house. If you want to talk about the <i>plans</i> for an action, though, then that action should be in verb form: the plans to launch a new product.</p>
			<p>In this sentence, the <i>plans</i> are designed <i>to cut the debt</i>, so the idiom should be <i>plans to cut</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (C) because they use <i>plans for cutting</i>.</p>
			<p>Answer (D) uses the correct idiom. Answers (B) and (E) don't use the idiom at all.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier / Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The final issue is subtle, but you might have spotted it when examining the idiom issue discussed above. Answer (E) says:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	The executive announced plans that are to cut the debt by selling assets .
			</pre>
			<p>The <i>that</i> modifier refers to the preceding noun, <i>plans</i>. In other words, <i>the plans are to cut the debt by selling assets</i>.This may sound perfectly fine, because people speak this way in the real world, however, the meaning is illogical.</p>
			<p>In the structure <i>the plans are to</i> do something, the <i>plans</i> themselves are about to undertake the described action. The meaning is similar to this: The executive announced the team that is to launch the new product. The team members themselves are the ones who will carry out the action. In the same way, according to the given sentence, the plans themselves are literally the ones who are going to carry out the action. This doesn't make sense; the plans can't execute themselves. Eliminate answer (E).</p>

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>was</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the conditional structure <i>if X, (then) Y</i>. Conditional structures require certain verb tenses, depending on the intended meaning of the sentence. (Note: Some answers don't specifically use the word <i>if</i>, but the conditional nature of the meaning is still clear.) </p>
			<p>In this case, the <i>if</i> portion is in past tense ( <i>if they did not hold it</i>) and the full meaning is hypothetical:</p>
			<p>They did not know what was going to happen after that. The second half of the structure, then, should be in the present conditional form: <i>Their grip would be insecure</i>. Answers (A) and (C) both incorrectly use simple past <i>was</i> for the conditional portion of the sentence; eliminate them.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it; that</i></b></p>
			<p>Four of the five answers use the pronoun <i>it</i>; answer (D) uses the pronoun <i>that</i>. The word <i>it</i> is a personal pronoun; the word <i>that</i> is a demonstrative pronoun.</p>
			<p>When demonstrative pronouns are used alone, not in conjunction with a noun, such as “that car,” they should not refer to a noun that is located within the same main clause. In answer (D), the pronoun <i>that</i> refers to <i>Morocco</i>, which is in the same main clause. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
			<p>The other four all use <i>it</i>, so they must all be correct, right? Not so fast. Answers (A) and (B) do correctly use <i>it</i>; first, the noun <i>Morocco</i> appears, then the pronoun <i>it</i>, which refers to <i>Morocco</i>, and finally <i>Algeria</i> (so it's clear that <i>it</i> does not refer to <i>Algeria</i>). In answers (C) and (E), however, the pronoun <i>it</i> does not appear until the end of the sentence. Do the French need to hold <i>Morocco</i> or <i>Algeria</i>? The sentence is no longer clear. Eliminate answers (C) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The original sentence says that <i>their grip was insecure</i>. Answer (B) conveys a similar meaning, this time with the correct conditional tense: <i>Their grip would never be secure</i>. In both cases, the <i>grip</i> is the thing that is (or is not) <i>secure</i>. Answer (D) changes this structure: The French <i>could never be secure about their grip</i>. What's the difference?</p>
			<p>The meaning in answer (D) no longer indicates whether the grip actually is secure. Rather, this choice talks about how the French feel about the situation. For example: The dog could not be secure about his grip on the bone (he wasn't sure he had a good grip on the bone). The dog's grip on the bone was not secure (he definitely did not have a good grip on the bone).</p>
			<p>The two sentences convey different meanings. Eliminate answer (D).</p>

			<p style="text-align: center;"><img align="middle" src="../../../assets/img/question/OG15-SC-70.png"/><p>
			<p>The structure isn't technically incorrect, but there is a potential idiom issue: <i>yielded evidence for</i>.</p>
			<p>Something can <i>yield evidence for</i> a noun, for example: Her poor performance yielded damning evidence for her boss. It's also possible to <i>yield evidence of</i> a noun: Her poor performance yielded evidence of incompetence. If, though, the intention is to talk about a more complex result presented in the form of a clause, then the proper structure is <i>yield evidence that</i>: Her poor performance yielded damning evidence that she was not qualified to do the job. Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>yields</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence does not underline the subject but does underline the verb. Further, this verb changes in format from answer to answer: <i>have yielded</i> in answers (A), (C), and (E) versus <i>yields</i> in answers (B) and (D).</p>

Answer (E) does chop out some extraneous words (<i>cut</i> in place of <i>that were cut</i>, <i>arose</i> in place of <i>that were arising</i>) but note that these substitutions are only preferred, not strictly necessary.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>endure; have encouraged</i></b></p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the time sequence is illogical: <i>Traditions endure</i> [<i>for</i>] <i>6,000 years</i>. The traditions don't just <i>endure</i> today. They <i>have endured</i> for a long period of time.</p>
			<p>Because the traditions began in the past, either the simple past should be used (if those traditions are no longer in place today) or the present perfect should be used (if those traditions are still in place today). Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Scan the other answers for verb issues. Answer (C) also mixes up the timeline: <i>Conditions have encouraged traditions that endured</i>. If the conditions are continuing to encourage certain traditions now, then those traditions still endure today and present perfect must be used. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>endured in; endured</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence talks about <i>traditions that endure in 6,000 years</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Endure in</i> a time period is an incorrect idiom. Rather, the traditions <i>endure for</i> a period of time. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Answers (B), (C), and (E) all correctly use <i>for</i>. Answer (D), though, does not use a preposition at all: <i>traditions that endured 6,000 years</i>. A person can endure some kind of trial; for example, a person endured a serious illness. Traditions (or people) cannot endure a time period, though. Rather, something <i>endures for</i> a period of time. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>combination of X and Y; combination of X and Y both</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the parallel structure <i>X and Y</i>.</p>
			<p>The form of <i>Y</i> differs in the five answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A), (B): combination of a supply and good growing conditions
	(C), (D), (E): combination of a supply and of good growing conditions
			</pre>
			<p>
			Further, answers (A) and (D) use the word <i>both</i> in this construction, but this word is dropped in the other choices. What represents the <i>X</i> portion? Is it <i>of a reliable supply</i> or just <i>a reliable supply</i>? Be very careful; the test writers are setting a trap here. The trap is to think that both the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions should start with <i>of</i>. The <i>of</i>, though, is part of the idiom <i>combination of</i> and shouldn't be repeated. How do you know? Meaning. Consider this simpler example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color: green;">The combination of peanut butter and jelly tastes very good. (Correct) </span>
	<span style="color: red;">The combination of peanut butter and of jelly tastes very good. (Incorrect)</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The second (incorrect) sentence appears to be talking about two different combinations: that of peanut butter and that of jelly. This is illogical; rather, the combination is “of peanut butter and jelly” together.</p>
			<p>Likewise, in the problem, it is illogical to say that the <i>combination of a water supply and</i> (separately) <i>of good conditions</i> led to something else. Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>
			<p>Further, note that answers (A) and (D) add the word <i>both</i> to the sentence. That word could begin its own idiom (<i>both X and Y</i>), but this structure doesn't exist in the sentence. Alternately, <i>both</i> could refer to the two things mentioned previously: <i>the combination of a supply and good conditions both encouraged</i> something. The addition of the word <i>both</i>, though, is redundant; the word <i>combination</i> means the same thing. Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Answer (B) correctly uses <i>have endured</i> to indicate something that started enduring in the past and still endures today. It also uses the proper idiom <i>endured for 6,000 years</i>.

		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had existed</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the past perfect: <i>Ice sheets had existed</i>. Other answers use the simple past <i>existed</i> . Which is correct?</p>
			<p>Past perfect is used to denote the longer-ago of two past actions. In this case, the <i>had existed</i> action is paired with a comment about the climate in those same areas <i>now</i>. It's acceptable, then, to use the simple past <i>existed</i>; don't use a more complex tense when a simple tense is acceptable. Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>In answer (A), <i>now currently</i> is redundant—both words mean the same thing. Eliminate answer (A), and examine the meaning in the other answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) existed in what are now temperate areas
	(C) existed where there were areas now temperate
	(D) existed in current temperate areas
	(E) existed in areas now that are temperate
			</pre>
			<p>Answer (D) drops <i>now</i> and switches from <i>currently</i> to <i>current</i>. That word is modifying the adjective <i>temperate</i>, so it needs to be in the adverb form (<i>currently</i>). The adjective form <i>current</i> can only be used to modify nouns. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
			<p>The other answers drop <i>currently</i> and use only <i>now</i>. Answers (B) and (C) are okay, but answer (E) has a meaning problem. The word <i>now</i> must be tied to a particular action or event: Something happened <i>now</i>. In answer (E), the word now is actually tied to <i>existed</i>: <i>Sheets existed now that are temperate</i>. Something can't be simultaneously in the past (<i>existed</i>) and happening <i>now</i>. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>Answer (C) also mixes two time frames: <i>were</i> and <i>now</i>. They <i>were</i> [<i>not</i>] <i>temperate</i> before; they <i>are temperate now</i>. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) fixes the initial verb error by switching to the simple past <i>existed</i>. The construction <i>in what are now temperate areas</i> properly indicates that the climate has changed in these areas. They used to be cold; they are now temperate.

Later, the sentence switches between <i>activates</i> and <i>activate</i>; one answer even changes to the noun form <i>activation</i>.
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>which</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence switches between the modifier structure <i>exhibit, which</i> and the parallel structure <i>exhibit and</i>.</p>
			<p>A “comma <i>which</i>” modifier must modify the preceding main noun. The exhibit doesn't activate itself, though. Logically, <i>thereby activates</i> is referring to the verb <i>touch</i>: The touch activates the exhibit. Eliminate answers (A) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Answer (B) doesn't use either the <i>exhibit, which</i> or the <i>exhibit and</i> structure. What is going on in answer (B)?</p>
			<p>There are a couple of different ways to interpret answer (B). The general meaning is this: <i>The Project encourages visitors to “touch” each exhibit, in turn </i> causing something else to happen. It would be possible, then, to say <i>in turn activating the functions</i>. This answer uses the noun form <i>activation</i>, though. Possibly, the sentence is introducing a new clause, but then the sentence would need another verb, and it doesn't have one. Alternately, perhaps the phrase after the comma is modifying the preceding noun, <i>exhibit</i>. This is illogical, though. The <i>exhibit</i> isn't an <i>activation</i> of anything. Essentially, it's impossible to tell what <i>activation</i> means or is referring to in the sentence. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) introduces a new subject and verb in the second half of the parallel portion: <i>and it will activate</i>. What <i>will activate</i>?</p>
			<p>Logically, the <i>touch</i> of a visitor should activate the <i>exhibit's functions</i>. The word <i>touch</i> can be a noun or a verb. In the given sentence, the word <i>touch</i> is used as a verb (<i>to “touch”</i>). A pronoun must refer to a noun, not a verb, so <i>it</i> can't refer to <i>touch</i> in answer (C). Nor can the noun be the word <i>exhibit</i> (the <i>exhibit</i> isn't activating itself), and no other noun in the sentence makes sense. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the original error by replacing <i>which</i> with <i>and</i>. Now, two verbs are appropriately parallel: <i>The Project encourages visitors to (X) “touch” each exhibit and thereby (Y) activate the functions </i>.

	Most of the sentence is underlined, likely signaling Structure, Modifier, Parallelism, or Meaning issues.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>covering the entire planet</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence begins with a modifier: <i>despite its covering the entire planet</i>. Opening modifiers should be followed by the words that they modify. In this case, does the opening modifier refer to the <i>Earth</i>?</p>
			<p>It doesn't make sense to say that the <i>Earth covers the entire planet</i>—the Earth actually is the planet. It would make more sense to say that the <i>Earth's crust covers the planet</i>. Sure enough, a comparison of the answers shows that, in answers (B), (C), and (D), the opening modifier refers to the <i>Earth's crust</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure:</b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains two independent clauses: <i>Earth has a crust</i> and <i>it is fragmented</i>. Independent clauses have to be connected with a coordinating conjunction or an appropriate punctuation mark, such as a semicolon.</p>
			<p>In this case, the two clauses are connected by the word <i>rather</i>, which is not a coordinating conjunction. This structure would be the equivalent of this sentence: The student was not tired, rather he was ready to study all night. Either the comma needs to be replaced by a semicolon or the word <i>rather</i> needs to be replaced by a coordinating conjunction, such as <i>and</i>. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>neither X nor Y, but (rather) Z</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (B), (C), and (D) contain the idiom <i>neither X nor Y, but (rather) Z</i>. The <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, and <i>Z</i> portions should be parallel. Compare the parallel structure in the answers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) crust is neither seamless 	nor is it stationary 	but is
	(C) crust is neither seamless 	nor is it stationary 	but rather
	(D) crust is neither seamless 	nor stationary 		but rather
			</pre>
			<p>In all three cases, the words immediately preceding the start of the idiom are <i>crust is</i>. These words, then, apply to all three items in the idiom. Answers (B) and (C) repeat the verb <i>is</i> for at least one of the later items; it's not possible to say <i>the crust is is it stationary</i> or <i>the crust is is fragmented</i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the original modifier error by placing <i>Earth's crust</i>, not the <i>Earth</i> itself, after the comma. Further, it corrects the original run-on sentence error by turning the second independent clause into a subset of the main clause.

			<p>A vertical comparison of the answers reveals a split between <i>economic</i> in answers (A), (C), and (E) and <i>economically</i> in answers (B) and (D). What is the difference between these two words?</p>
			<p><i>Economic</i> is an adjective, while <i>economically</i> is an adverb. The difference goes beyond form, however; these two words have different meanings. <i>Economic</i> refers to the economy; <i>economic development</i> is a synonym for business development. <i>Economically</i>, on the other hand, can relate to the economy but more commonly means “in a frugal or cost-effective manner.” <i>Greater development economically</i>, then, means development done in a cost-effective way—not a logical meaning for the sentence. Eliminate answers (B) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>as a means for</i></b>
			<b>Meaning: as a means of</i></b></p>
			<p>The first word of each answer changes; the options are <i>to</i>,<i>of</i>, and <i>for</i>. These prepositions are a part of the idiom <i>as a means ______</i> . Which is correct?</p>
			<p>Both <i>as a means to</i> and <i>as a means of</i> are valid idioms; <i>as a means for</i> is not. Eliminate answer (E). The two valid idioms have different meanings. <i>X as a means to Y</i> indicates that <i>X</i> is used in order to </p>
			<p>make <i>Y</i> happen or to achieve <i>Y</i> result. <i>X as a means of Y</i> indicates that <i>X</i> is a type of <i>Y</i>. In this sentence, the cities are using the arts in order to help promote economic development; this meaning matches the idiom <i>as a means to</i>. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>A vertical comparison of the end of each answer indicates a split between <i>investing</i>, <i>invest</i>, and <i>the investment of</i>. The word <i>and</i> appears right before these options, indicating parallelism. In the idiom <i>X and Y</i>, what is the <i>X</i> portion?</p>
			<p>In answers (A) and (B), the <i>Y</i> form is <i>investing</i>; is there a parallel match? Yes—<i>cities are stressing</i> one thing and <i>investing</i> in another. The match is both structurally and logically parallel.</p>
			<p>In answers (C) and (D), the <i>Y</i> form is <i>invest</i>; is there a parallel match? There isn't another similar verb form in the sentence; eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) is interesting. Technically, <i>the investment of</i> is a structural match for <i>greater economic development</i>. It's illogical, however, to say that <i>cities are stressing the arts for X</i> ( <i>economic development</i>) <i>and Y</i> (<i>investing millions</i>). Rather, the cities are choosing to invest millions because they think this action will help economic development. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (A) uses the appropriate idiom, <i>as a means to</i>, as well as the appropriate adjective to mean business development ( <i>economic</i>). Further, the <i>X and Y</i> portion of the sentence is parallel.

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Verb: <i>appear</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence says that <i>Neanderthals appear</i> a certain way but also indicates that they became <i>extinct</i> a long time ago. If Neanderthals are extinct, they can't actually <i>appear</i> a certain way today.</p>
			<p>At first glance, the verb split seems to be simple: <i>appear</i> versus <i>appeared</i>. Answers (B) and (E), though, have more complex verb structures: <i>appear(ed) to have been equipped</i>. If Stella <i>appears</i> happy, she is that way right now. If Stella <i>appears to have been</i> happy when she lived 100 years ago, then the sentence is referring to a past event or occurrence that appears to be true to people who are today examining that history.</p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (C) use <i>Neanderthals appear</i> without the additional verbiage to indicate the past; eliminate both. Answer (B) uses <i>appear to have been equipped</i>; this choice properly indicates the time frame. It <i>appears</i> today that <i>the Neanderthals</i> were <i>equipped</i> in the past.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idioms: <i>appear as; equipped for</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the idioms <i>appear as (equipped)</i> and <i>equipped for (facing)</i>.</p>
			<p>The idiom <i>appear as</i> can be followed by a noun: She appeared as a witch in the school play. When followed by a verb, however, the idiom should say <i>appear to</i> (verb). In this case, the sentence would need something such as <i>appear to be equipped</i>. Eliminate answers (A), (C), and (D).</p>
			<p>The idiom <i>equipped for</i> could also be followed by a noun: We are equipped for the pending apocalypse. When followed by a verb, however, the idiom should say <i>equipped to</i> (verb). In this case, the sentence should say <i>equipped to face</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (E).</p>

	<div><b>Miscellaneous</b></div>
	The split between <i>path</i> and <i>paths</i> is a red herring.

It is also possible, however, to talk about the figurative <i>path</i> taken by the species as a whole. Instead of trying to decipher which meaning the sentence intends, concentrate on other issues.

		<li>
			<p><b>Verb / Meaning: <i>had been; have been</i></b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence uses the past perfect tense <i>had been allowed</i> to refer to a change made in a 1972 agreement. How is past perfect used correctly?</p>
			<p>Past perfect refers to the longer-ago of two past actions. In this case, the 1972 agreement <i>reduced</i> a certain thing and that reduction would have to take place after the agreement, not before. It's incorrect to use past perfect for the later of the two actions; eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
			<p>Note also that answer (B) drops the <i>allowed</i> wording. As a result, this answer is talking about the actual amount that was dumped (legally or illegally); further, the past perfect <i>had been dumping</i> means that they somehow reduced the amount that had been dumped in the past, prior to the 1972 agreement. What took place in the past can't be changed! Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>Answer (C) uses the present perfect <i>have been</i>. Present perfect refers to something that started in the past and still continues or is still true in the present. Did the <i>have been</i> event begin prior to 1972 or after 1972? It's not clear. Eliminate answer (C) for ambiguous meaning.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb : <i>reduces</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (E) change the past tense <i>reduced</i> to the present tense <i>reduces</i>.</p>
			<p>The agreement took place in 1972. The verb tense in the original sentence, <i>reduced</i>, is properly in the past. The present tense <i>reduces</i> is illogical, as the action clearly occurred in the past. It would be acceptable to use the present perfect <i>has reduced</i>, but no answer choices offer this option. Eliminate answers (C) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>allowed for</i></b></p>
			<p>The four answers that use the <i>allowed</i> wording have different prepositions following that word. Answers (A), (C), and (D) all say <i>allowed to</i>. Answer (E) says <i>allowed for</i>. Are both idioms correct?</p>
			<p>When the word <i>allowed</i> is followed by a verb, the correct idiom is <i>allowed to</i>. <i>Allowed for</i> is incorrect; eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the initial verb error by changing the past perfect <i>had been allowed</i> to the present <i>are allowed</i>. Note that some people might eliminate this choice because they think the verb should be in past tense, but it is acceptable to use present tense here if the agreement itself is still in place in the present.

			<p>The <i>X and Y</i> structure in answer (A) does not require the two parallel portions to have anything to do with one another.

Tourists will continue to do these two things, but the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions don't have anything to do with each other.</p>
			<p>Similarly, in the original sentence, if the actions <i>visit game parks</i> and <i>see rhinoceroses</i> are connected by the word <i>and</i>, then they are completely separate.

Consider this example: These tourists will travel to foreign countries and meet new people after their visas are approved. Whose visas need to get approved? The tourists, not the new people—the tourists are the ones who are traveling.</p>
			<p>Because <i>their</i> could refer to tourists (it should refer to <i>rhinoceroses</i>), answer (A) is ambiguous. Answer (B) repeats this error; eliminate both.</p>
			<p>Answers (B) and (E) replace <i>rhinoceroses</i> with the pronoun <i>one</i>. First, it's okay to use the number <i>one</i> to refer to a plural noun; this construction just means <i>one of those</i>. One of what, though? Logically, one <i>rhinoceros</i> makes sense, but maybe the question is whether tourists will continue to see <i>poachers</i> after the poachers have been discouraged from killing the rhinos—that's also a reasonable interpretation. The word <i>one</i>, then, is ambiguous. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>

			<p><b>Verb: <i>are</i></b></p>
			<p>A vertical scan of the end of each answer choice reveals a split between present tense <i>are</i> and past perfect <i>have been</i>. Are both acceptable?</p>
			<p>Verb tenses convey a time frame for an action and indicate when different actions happen relative to one another. In this sentence, the <i>trimming of the horns</i> must happen before a possible <i>visit</i> by tourists, so the simple present tense is inappropriate. The present perfect <i>have been</i> properly indicates that, at the time of a potential tourist visit, the horns must already have been trimmed. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (D).</p>

	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the initial pronoun error by replacing <i style="color: red;">their</i> with <i style="color: green;">the animals’</i>. Furthermore, the sentence changes the <i style="color: red;">X and Y</i> construction to one with a more logical meaning: <i style="color: green;">the tourists visit parks to see rhinoceroses.</i>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>Miscellaneous</b></div>
	<p>Nowadays, <i>whether</i> and <i>if</i> are mostly used interchangeably. Formally, though, <i>whether</i> is used to indicate the meaning <i>whether or not</i>: Tell me whether you plan to go to the movies—I want to know whether you do or whether you don't. On the other hand, <i>if</i> is used for if–then (conditional) clauses: If you buy me an ice cream, I'll be happy.</p>
	<p>To date, no published official GMAT questions have used <i>if</i> in a correct answer choice when the meaning technically matches the word <i>whether</i>. The official answer explanations, however, don't actually mention this issue. If you need to guess, don't pick an answer that uses <i>if</i> when the meaning is really <i>whether or not</i>.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X, Y, and Z</i></b></p>
			<p>There appears to be an <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>, <i>and Z</i> list overlapping the underline: <i>The literatures of X (Europe), Y (China), and Z</i> (__________). Bingo—parallelism! <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are already parallel. Is <i>Z</i>?</p>
			<p>The first two items in the list are geographic locations ( <i>Europe</i> and <i>China</i>). The third item should also be a location. <i>That of</i> refers to the word literature, but the list <i>Europe, China, and the literature of Japan</i> is not parallel. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>were</i></b></p>
			<p>The main subject of the original sentence is the word <i>knowledge</i>, which is singular. The main verb is <i>were</i>, which is plural.</p>
			<p>The subject, <i>knowledge</i>, is not underlined, so the correct answer must contain a singular verb. Scan the answers; answers (A) and (E) both use the plural verb <i>were</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (E).</p>
			<p>Note: Why isn't the subject <i>literatures</i>? That's the trap! The word <i>literatures</i> is part of a prepositional phrase— <i>of the literatures</i>—and a noun within a prepositional phrase can't be the subject of the sentence.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>both X as well as Y; both X in addition to Y</i></b></p>
			<p>A vertical comparison of the answers reveals an idiom that's changing from answer to answer: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) informing his literary style 	as much as the content
	(B) informed both his literary style 	as well as the content
	(C) informing both his literary style 	and the content
	(D) informed his literary style 	as much as the content
	(E) informing both his literary style 	in addition to the content
			</pre>
			<p>Notice that the <i>X</i> (<i>his literary style</i>) and <i>Y</i> ( <i>the content</i>) don't change, but the construction of the idiom itself does.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) uses the structure <i>both X as well as Y</i>; answer (E) uses <i>both X in addition to Y</i>. When beginning with the word <i>both</i>, the correct idiomatic structure is <i>both X and Y</i>, as in answer (C). Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Answer (D) tosses in a lot of instances of the word <i>as</i>: <i>as a writer, as it informed his literary style as much as the content of his fiction</i>. Some might think that this sounds wordy or awkward. Why?</p>
			<p>The sentence is attempting to say that <i>Akutagawa's knowledge</i> informed two things: (1) <i>his style</i> and (2) <i>the content</i> of his work. The structure of answer (D) creates an ambiguous meaning. It might mean that his <i>knowledge</i> informed his <i>style</i> and that his <i>knowledge</i> also informed his <i>content</i>, both to the same extent or level. Alternately, it might mean that his <i>knowledge</i> informed his <i>style</i> and that his <i>content</i> also informed his <i>style</i>.</p>
			<p>Consider this shorter example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	The barking dog scared the mouse as much as the cat.
			</pre>
			<p>Did the barking dog equally scare both the cat and the mouse? Or did both the barking dog and the cat equally scare the mouse? It's not clear. Eliminate answer (D).</p>

	Answer (C) corrects the original parallelism error by dropping the <i>that of</i>, resulting in a correctly constructed <i>X, Y, and Z</i> list.

			<p>The word <i>citrus</i> is singular; the pronouns <i>them</i> and <i>they</i> are plural.</p>
			<p>Plural pronouns can't refer to a singular noun. The question writer wants some students to mistake <i>citrus</i> for a plural noun because it ends in the letter <i>s</i>.

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>the only way to X is to Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence uses the construction <i>the only way to X is to Y</i>. This idiom requires verbs in the infinitive form (i.e., <i>to salvage</i> and <i>to process</i>).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The core of the original sentence reads <i>fossils made it the earliest known mammal</i>. The meaning is illogical. The discovery of the fossils made the sloth the earliest known mammal, not the fossils themselves.</p>
			<p>Eliminate answer (A) for an illogical meaning. The remaining answers don't repeat this error. Answer (B) does use the pronoun <i>it</i>, but <i>it</i> is part of the “comma -ing” modifier <i>making it</i>. The modifier refers to the entire clause <i>fossils</i> [<i>have</i>] <i>been dated at 34 million years old</i>, and it is accurate to say that the dating of the fossils makes the <i>sloth the earliest known mammal</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>they</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (B) introduces the pronoun <i>they</i>. Who are <i>they</i>?</p>
			<p>The sentence doesn't say. The only two plural nouns in the sentence are <i>fossils</i> and <i>islands</i>, neither of which could have found the fossils. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>has; was</i></b></p>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Answer (E) has a confusing structure.<i>Fossils of a sloth which was dated at 34 million years old, made the sloth the earliest known mammal </i>. The <i>sloth was dated at</i> a certain age? This doesn't make sense; the <i>fossils</i> are dated, not the <i>sloth</i> itself—but the sentence also can't say the <i>fossils was dated</i>. If <i>was dated</i> does go with <i>sloth</i>, then why is there a comma before the verb <i>made</i>, but not one before <i>which</i>, where a comma is required?</p>
			<p>The modifier <i>found in Puerto Rico in 1991</i> is set off by a pair of commas. The third comma, between <i>old</i> and <i>made</i>, is extra—it's not part of a pair. Sentences shouldn't have a random comma separating the subject and verb: The sloth, took a nap (incorrect). A pair of commas should be in the middle only to separate out modifiers: The sloth, which was tired, took a nap (correct).</p>
			<p>No acceptable subject–verb core exists in the sentence. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

<div class="round-box">

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>in attributing</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence consists of two independent clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction (the word <i>but</i>):</p>
			<p><i>Defense attorneys have argued X, but in attributing Y, the perpetrators are told Z </i>. Because the “comma -ing” modifier is after the word <i>but</i>, the modifier refers to the second half of the sentence. As a result, the <i>perpetrators</i> must be performing the action of <i>attributing</i> something, but this is illogical. If the perpetrators <i>are told</i> something, then someone else must be doing the <i>attributing</i>.</p>
			<p>The first half of the sentence indicates that the defense attorneys are the ones attributing the bad behavior to an allergy. Logically, then, an <i>in attributing</i> modifier should be placed with the first half of the sentence. The word <i>but</i> is not underlined, though, so this modifier has to stick with the second half of the sentence. The form <i>in attributing</i>, therefore, can't be used; eliminate answers (A), (C), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>attributed X as Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The first three answers use the form <i>attributing (attributed) X to Y</i>. The final two answers use the form <i>attributing (attributed) X as Y</i>. Are both acceptable?</p>

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) fixes the original modifier error by changing <i>in attributing X</i> to <i>if X is attributed</i>. The form <i>in attributing</i> requires the attached main subject ( <i>perpetrators</i>) to perform that action; in this case, that meaning is illogical. The form <i>if X is attributed</i> doesn't require this (note that, in this second case, the sentence doesn't say exactly who is doing the attributing; that's okay).

		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>much</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence talks about <i>much of the dioxins</i>. Note: Mentally strip out the extra words (<i>currently uncontrolled</i>) in order to make sure that <i>much</i> and <i>dioxins</i> are well paired.</p>
			<p><i>Dioxins</i> are countable: one dioxin, two dioxins, three dioxins. The modifier <i>much</i>, though, is used for uncountable nouns: there is much water, but there are many bottles of water. Answers (A), (B), and (C) all attempt to use the uncountable modifier <i>much</i> to talk about the countable word <i>dioxins</i>; eliminate them.</p>
			<p>Note that answer (B) is also incorrect because the subject <i>much</i> is singular and the verb <i>come</i> is plural. This issue is moot, though, if you notice that <i>much</i> is the wrong modifier in the first place.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier </b></p>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (E) present the information about dioxins and exposure as one long modifier, while answers (C) and (D) separate this portion into two parallel pieces of information:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color: green;">(A), (B), (E): the currently uncontrolled dioxins (that / to which) North Americans are exposed</span>  
	<span style="color: red;">(C), (D): the dioxins that are currently uncontrolled and (that) North Americans are exposed to</span>
			</pre>
			<p>What's the difference?</p>
			<p>When two pieces of information are placed in parallel, they are not required to have a logical connection with each other. For example: After studying all day, Sam concluded that geometry is his favorite topic and that he would learn more with a study partner. The two modifiers, “that geometry” and “that he would,” don't have anything to do with one another directly (beyond the fact that Sam concluded both after studying all day).</p>
			<p>Should the given problem separate these two pieces of information or keep them together? Logically, they go together: North Americans are exposed to the uncontrolled dioxins. Answers (C) and (D) make <i>that North Americans are exposed to</i> just a second, separate description of <i>dioxins</i>, so this connected meaning is lost; eliminate them.</p>
		</li>

<div class="round-box">

			<p>In answers (C), (D), and (E), the verb precedes the parallel structure and therefore already applies to both <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i>.

			<p>The sentence compares two groups: <i>young adults</i> today and those of <i>earlier generations</i>. The heart of the comparison is the fact that <i>owning and living in a freestanding house on its own land is a goal</i> of both groups. In other words, the full comparison itself is a clause, so <i>as</i> should be used to make the comparison (<i>like</i> is used to compare nouns). Further, <i>as</i> is used to compare two clauses but the second half of the comparison in answer (B) does not include a verb. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) all correctly use <i>as</i> and include a verb in the second half of the comparison. Which is correct? Parallelism still rules the day. <i>Owning and living is a goal</i> today <i>as owning and living was a goal</i> in the past.

			<p>Note that <i>was</i> and <i>is</i> are different tenses, but the clauses are still parallel.

		<li>
			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains one independent clause,<i>ozone is formed</i>, followed by a modifier starting with the word <i>from</i>. Later in the sentence, a second verb, <i>react</i>, pops up. What subject goes with that second verb?</p>
			<p>Logically, <i>react</i> might go with <i>hydrocarbons and oxides</i>. This sentence would result: <i>ozone is formed from hydrocarbons and oxides react</i>. <i>React</i> is a main verb and needs a main subject to match, but <i>hydrocarbons and oxides</i> are part of a prepositional phrase. Prepositional phrases don't contain verbs. A noun in a prepositional phrase isn't eligible to be the subject of a verb. In this structure, no main subject exists for the main verb. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) also uses <i>from</i> and further compounds the issue by changing the first independent clause to a modifier: <i>ozone, formed in X from Y, react with Z</i>. The verb <i>react</i> can't go with ozone (<i>the hydrocarbons and oxides react</i> to form <i>ozone</i>, not the other way around), so the sentence is a fragment; it contains no main verb. Answer (D) also removes the original independent clause and turns the sentence into a fragment. Eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>
			<p>Answer (C) introduces the word <i>and</i> in between the original independent clause and the rest of the sentence. The portion after the word <i>and</i> needs to be an independent clause as well, but it is not. Consider this incorrect example, which mimics the error in answer (C): Hamburgers are made at the restaurant, and when customers eat them. A correct version might say: Hamburgers are made at the restaurant, and customers eat them. Eliminate answer (C).</p>

	Correct answer (B) fixes the original problem by changing the preposition <i>from</i> to the conjunction <i>when</i> : <i>ozone is formed when hydrocarbons and oxides react</i>. The verb <i>react</i> now has a subject.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had flourished; flourishing</i></b></p>
			<p>A vertical scan of the answers reveals three different forms at the beginning: <i>that flourished</i>, <i>that had flourished</i>, and <i>flourishing</i>.</p>
			<p><i>That flourished</i> (simple past) and <i>that had flourished</i> (past perfect) are both regular verb forms. Past perfect is used to distinguish between two past events or time frames, one of which occurred earlier in time than the other. In this case, the various civilizations <i>flourished at the same time</i>, so there is no reason to use past perfect. Answer (C) does use the simple past <i>flourished</i> but later uses <i>had [flourished]</i> for the other civilizations. The various civilizations <i>flourished at the same time</i>, so they should not be described using different verb tenses. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>
			<p>In answers (D) and (E), <i>flourishing</i> is a modifier and describes the time frame of the main verb in the sentence. Consider this example: She slipped on the ice, breaking her ankle. The breaking occurred in the past because the main verb “slipped” is in past tense. In the given sentence, the main verb, <i>threaten</i>, is in the present tense, illogically implying that <i>ancient civilizations</i> are still <i>flourishing</i> in the present. Eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>those</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) replace the noun <i>civilizations</i> with the pronoun <i>those</i>.</p>
			<p>The pronoun <i>those</i> needs to refer to a noun, but the plural noun <i>civilizations</i> has been removed from the sentence. Only the singular <i>civilization</i> remains, but the plural <i>those</i> can't refer to the singular <i>civilization</i>. Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>at the same time as</i></b></p>
			<p>Four answers contain the idiom <i>at the same time as</i>; answer (C), though, omits the word <i>as</i>.</p>
			<p>The word <i>as</i> is a necessary component of the idiom <i>at the same time as</i>; it can't be omitted. Eliminate answer (C).</p>

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence says that <i>it fell over the last two years</i>. What <i>fell</i>?</p>
			<p>Logically, the <i>profits fell</i>. The word <i>profits</i>, though, is plural, while the pronoun <i>it</i> is singular. Bad match! Answer (B) repeats this error. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had increased</i></b></p>
			<p>A vertical scan of the answers reveals a difference in verb tenses: <i>increased</i>, <i>had increased</i>, and <i>have increased</i>.</p>
			<p>Two things happened in the past, with one thing happening before the other. Answer (B) uses past perfect for both the <i>first 3 months of this year</i> and the <i>last two years</i>. Only the longer-ago event should use the past perfect; eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>It's acceptable to use the simple past, as in answer (A), or the present perfect, as in answer (C). Answer (A) is a bit clunky because it uses the simple past for two events that took place at different times in the past. Don't cross answer (A) off just for this, but be skeptical; it's probably not correct.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>with</i></b></p>
			<p>The first word of the answers varies. Answers (A), (B), and (C) start with <i>which</i>, while answers (D) and (E) use <i>with</i>.</p>
			<p>“Comma <i>which</i>” is a noun modifier, so this clause is talking about the main noun before the comma: <i>profits</i>. Does that make sense? Yes—<i>the profits have increased 5 percent</i>.</p>
			<p>“Comma <i>with</i>” is an adverbial modifier, which refers to the entire clause, not just the noun before the comma. What was <i>with a 5 percent increase</i>? The core of a clause is the subject, verb, and object (if there is an object), so the <i>results are evident</i>, <i>with a 5 percent increase</i>. Huh? That doesn't make sense. Here's a correct example: The dog barked happily at the moon, with joy exuding from every fiber of his being. The joy isn't exuding from the moon. The joy is exuding from the happily barking dog.</p>
			<p>Eliminate answers (D) and (E) because the “comma <i>with</i>” modifier is not clearly referring to the preceding noun, <i>profits</i>.</p>

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Verb: <i>are; have</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence tries to use a structure that provides an unstated but assumed repetition of a word: <i>The wines have been priced to sell, and they are</i> (selling). When such a structure is used, the word that is understood to be repeated needs to be in the same form in which it already appeared in the sentence: <i>The wines have been priced to sell, and they are</i> (sell).</p>
			<p>It's incorrect to say <i>they are sell</i>, so answer (A) is wrong. Answers (B), (D), and (E) make a similar error: <i>they have</i> (sell). Only answer (C) offers a correct structure: <i>The wines are priced to sell, and they do</i> (sell). Eliminate answers (A), (B), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had been</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (A) begins with the present perfect <i>have been</i>. Answers (B), (C), and (D) switch the tense to present tense <i>are</i>, while answer (E) uses the past perfect <i>had been</i>.</p>
			<p>In the non-underlined portion, the <i>vintners have cut prices</i>; the present perfect tense is used. <i>Pricing</i> something <i>to sell</i> generally means to cut the price, so <i>pricing the wines to sell</i> cannot logically take place before the <i>vintners cut the prices</i>; these two actions are the same. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) provides the proper structure for repeating a word in an unstated way: The <i>wines are priced to sell, and they do</i> (sell). The repeated word, <i>sell</i>, can be picked up as is and inserted as part of the final clause.

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Parallelism: <i>both X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence appears to contain the parallel structure <i>both X and Y</i>: <i>a body of work both rooted in the tradition of Willie Smith and Duke Ellington</i>. In this case, the <i>X</i> portion is <i>rooted in</i>… and the <i>Y</i> portion is <i>Duke Ellington.</i></p>
			<p><i>Rooted</i> can't be parallel to <i>Duke Ellington</i>. Either the two people need to be made parallel or two actions need to be made parallel. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Scan the end of the remaining answers. Answers (B) and (E) also use the word <i> both: rooted both in the tradition of Willie Smith and Duke Ellington.</i> As in the first answer choice, <i>in the tradition</i> cannot be parallel to <i>Duke Ellington</i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
			<p>The two remaining answers remove the word <i>both</i>; there are not actually two <i>traditions</i> or two things <i>rooted in</i> something. The only place where the word <i>both</i> might make sense is in conjunction with the two people: <i>both Smith and Ellington</i>. That portion of the sentence isn't underlined, though, so the word <i>both</i> actually should be removed.</p>

			<p>Answer (D) contains a subject and main verb. Answer (C), though, changes the main verb <i>produced</i> into a modifier (<i>who produced</i>). Following this modifier, answer (C) contains a subordinate clause: <i>Monk, who produced X, yet in many ways he stood apart</i>.

			<p>You might spot this either when examining the comparison issue discussed above or when comparing the answers vertically. For the first comparison, some answers use the form <i>higher this year than last</i>, while others say <i>higher this year than last year's</i>.</p>
			<p><i>This year</i> and <i>last year</i> are the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> of the comparison: <i>X higher than Y</i>. As such, parallelism is required.

			<p>The word <i>what</i>, which is intended to refer to the price, is redundant.

			<p>This contrast is illogical. Answer (E) makes the same error: <i>while Clovis points are spear points, they have been found all over North America </i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>of</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (A) and answer (B) contain a slight difference in their descriptions of <i>Clovis points: spear points (with / of) longitudinal grooves chipped onto their faces</i>. Are both versions acceptable?</p>
			<p>It's acceptable to say <i>spear points with grooves</i> but <i>not spear points of grooves</i>, because the meaning of the second version is illogical. <i>With grooves</i> indicates that the spear points consist of cores of material into which grooves have been chipped. <i>Of grooves</i> indicates that the <i>spear points</i> consist fundamentally or principally of <i>grooves</i>; that is, the <i>spear points</i> are themselves <i>grooves</i>. Eliminate answer (B).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>have been</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (D) all use the past tense <i>were discovered</i>. Answers (C) and (E) use the present perfect <i>have been found / discovered</i>. Are both tenses acceptable?</p>
			<p>The discovery took place in 1932 and was a one-time event: the <i>points</i> were <i>found</i> and that was that. As a result, it's inappropriate to use the present perfect tense; eliminate answers (C) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure</b></p>
			<p>The subject of answer (D) is <i>Clovis points</i>. What is the main verb of the sentence?</p>
			<p>There isn't one. The <i>even though</i> portion is a subordinate clause, as is the <i>but were found</i> portion. Answer (D) is a sentence fragment. Further, the sentence introduces both sides of the comparison with contrast words (<i>even though</i> and <i>but</i>). It's only necessary to use one contrast word; using two is considered redundant. Eliminate answer (D).</p>

	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (A) makes a logical contrast between the fact that the <i>Clovis points</i> were found in many locations but named for only one particular location. The sentence also uses appropriate verb tenses.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure: <i>that</i></b></p>
			<p>In this sentence, the em dash indicates a rephrasing of something written earlier in the sentence; the em dash, then, means “in other words.” The sentence structure needs to follow parallelism rules: <i>Anthropologists believe that X</i> is true— <i>in other words, that Y</i> is true (a rewording of or an elaboration on <i>X</i>). In the original sentence, the <i>Y</i> portion is missing the word <i>that</i>.</p>
			<p>Answers (A), (D), and (E) all lack the word <i>that</i> at the beginning of the clause after the em dash. Answer (E) does contain the word <i>that</i> later in the clause, but parallelism requires <i>that</i> to be at the beginning. Eliminate answers (A), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure: <i>some time</i></b></p>
			<p>A vertical comparison of the answers reveals a split between <i>at some time in the past</i> and <i>some time in the past</i>.</p>
			<p>The prepositional phrase <i>at some time</i> refers to some particular (but unspecified) moment in time; this construction is a modifier. If the preposition <i>at</i> is not placed before <i>some time</i>, then <i>time</i> is a noun, not a modifier, but the sentence structure requires a modifier here. The adverb <i>sometime</i> could be used, or the prepositional phrase <i>at some time</i>. Here are two correct examples: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	At some time in the past, she worked for the rodeo. 
	Sometime in the past, she worked for the rodeo.
			</pre>
			<p>Eliminate answers (C) and (D) for incorrectly changing a modifier into a noun.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence offers a parallel <i>X and Y</i> structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) greatly reducing their numbers and our variation
	(B) greatly reduced their numbers and our variation
	(C) their numbers were reduced and our variation 
	(D) their numbers were reduced and our variation 
	(E) reduce their numbers and our variation
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (E) all contain proper parallelism between the nouns <i>numbers</i> and <i>variation</i>. Further, the verb just preceding the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> structure (<i>reducing</i>, <i>reduced</i>, or <i>reduce</i>) applies to both numbers and variation.</p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (D), though, break parallelism. The <i>X</i> portion is a clause (<i>numbers were reduced</i>) and the <i>Y</i> portion is a noun ( <i>variation</i>). It's not acceptable to make a clause parallel to a noun; eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>so as to</i></b></p>
			<p>The phrase <i>so as to</i> means “in order to.” This phrase is used in answer (E): <i>ancestors suffered an event so as to reduce their numbers</i>.</p>
			<p>The <i>ancestors</i> did not <i>suffer the event</i> on purpose in order to achieve some specific outcome. Rather, something terrible happened that resulted in a significant loss of life and other long-term consequences. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) begins with the appropriate parallelism marker, <i>that</i>, and conveys a clear meaning: a terrible event occurred that caused two related outcomes, one immediate and one longer- term.

		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>X more than Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence contains the comparison marker <i>X more than Y</i>. Check the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions for parallelism.</p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the <i>X</i> portion is <i>works</i> and the <i>Y</i> portion is <i>dramatist</i>. It is illogical to </p>
			<p>compare the <i>works</i> of one person to other people. Compare works to works or people to people; don't mix the two. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (C), which all contain this error.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>more as</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the comparison marker <i>X more than Y</i>. Note that the word <i>more</i> is not underlined but the word <i>than</i> is. Among the answers, four offer the word <i>than</i>, but answer (E) changes <i>than</i> to <i>as</i>.</p>
			<p>The phrase <i>more as</i> is incorrect. Something can be <i>more than</i> something else or something can be <i>as much as</i> something else, but the two comparison idioms cannot be mixed. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	<p>Correct answer (D) fixes the original parallelism error by inserting the pronoun <i>those</i>, which refers back to the first part of the comparison, <i>works</i>. The sentence properly compares the <i>works</i> of one dramatist to the <i>works</i> of other dramatists.</p> <p>Note that the correct answer inserts the word <i>other</i>. Some test-takers might use this as an excuse to eliminate the correct answer, believing that it changes the meaning of the sentence. It does change the meaning, though in an acceptable way. Kroetz is himself a dramatist; in the original sentence, his works are illogically included in both the first group and the second group in the comparison. He should not be included in the second group; <i>his works are produced more often than</i> the works of the <i>other</i> people who are producing similar works.</p>

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>at tremendous speeds</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence says that <i>the stars, some of them at tremendous speeds, are in motion</i>. The <i>stars</i> themselves don't occur <i>at tremendous speeds</i>; rather, the <i>motion</i> occurs <i>at tremendous speeds</i>. The modifier should be pointing to the action (<i>motion</i>), not the noun (<i>stars</i>).</p>
			<p>Answers (B), (C), and (D) all clearly tie the motion to the speeds: <i>in motion, some of them at tremendous speeds</i>. Like answer (A), answer (E) muddles the meaning of this modifier: <i>the planets, some of which at tremendous speeds are in motion</i>.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, in answer (E), the <i>some of which</i> modifier points to the preceding noun, <i>planets</i>, not the <i>stars</i>. This answer, then, says that <i>the planets are in motion</i>. It's already common knowledge that <i>planets</i> are <i>in motion</i>; the point of the original sentence was to highlight that the <i>stars</i> are also <i>in motion</i> even though they seem to be fixed in the sky. Eliminate answers (A) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>The original sentence consists of an independent clause ( <i>the stars are in motion as the planets are</i>) followed by a comma and a coordinating conjunction (<i>yet</i>), setting up the expectation for another independent clause.</p>
			<p>Chop out the portion after the coordinating conjunction ( <i>being so far that X</i>) and read it on its own; that portion is not a complete sentence. The word <i>being</i> could function as a subject—as in the sentence <i>Being far away from loved ones can cause homesickness</i>—but no verb completes the thought. Eliminate answers (A) and (C) because they are sentence fragments.</p>
			<p>Answer (C)'s issue is even more severe. <i>Although like</i> is momentarily confusing (because one indicates contrast and the other similarity) and the use of both <i>although</i> and <i>yet</i> is redundant; only one contrast word is needed. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>as</i></b></p>
			<p>Some of the answers contain the comparison marker <i>like</i>; others use the marker <i>as</i>. <i>Like</i> is used to compare two nouns directly; <i>as</i> is used to compare clauses.</p>
			<p>Answer (A) correctly uses <i>as</i> to compare two clauses. Answers (B), (C), and (E) correctly use <i>like</i> to compare two nouns. Answer (D), however, uses <i>as</i> to compare two nouns. Eliminate (D).</p>

<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) consists of two independent clauses connected by a comma and a coordinating conjunction. The sentence makes clear that the <i>motion</i> occurs <i>at tremendous speeds</i>.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it; them; ones</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the pronoun <i>it</i> (twice!). Check the antecedents for the pronouns found throughout the answers.</p>
			<p>In answer (A), the first <i>it</i> refers to the <i>course of action</i>. The second <i>it</i>, though, is a dummy pronoun; it doesn't refer to any particular noun in the sentence. While a dummy pronoun is acceptable in general, the two instances of <i>it</i> don't refer to the same thing. This is considered ambiguous. Likewise, in answer (D), the first instance of <i>them</i> refers to the <i>executives</i>; the second refers to the <i>signs</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (D) for ambiguity.</p>
			<p>Answer (B) changes <i>them</i> to <i>ones</i>. The pronoun <i>ones</i>  does still refer to <i>signs</i>, but it refers to different signs. For example: Ava likes most cats, but she finds the ones owned by her next-door neighbor annoying.</p>
			<p>The <i>ones</i> are still cats, but they are not the same cats mentioned in the first half of the sentence. The original sentence talks about the same signs, so the meaning in answer (B) is illogical.</p>
			<p>Further, in (B), the modifier following <i>ones</i> ( <i>likely when they do appear</i>) now applies only to the second set of signs, in the same way that the modifier in Ava's sentence ( <i>owned by her next-door neighbor</i>) applies only to the second set of cats. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>In answer (C), the pronoun <i>it</i> seems to refer to the closest preceding singular noun, <i>trouble</i>. The <i>trouble</i> has <i>worked well in the past</i>? That's illogical. Because the pronoun <i>it</i> is acting as a subject, the next logical place to check is the subject of the preceding clause: <i>an executive</i>.<i>An executive</i>, though, can't be an <i>it</i>. The logical noun, <i>course of action</i>, is so buried in the early part of the sentence that you may actually have to re-read the sentence in order to find the right noun. Another ambiguous pronoun! Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The original sentence conveys a certain meaning: when someone commits heavily to a certain course of action, that person might then overlook signs that this course of action isn't a good idea after all. Check the sentence core:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) Heavy commitment makes it likely to miss 
	(B) An executive makes missing signs likely 
	(C) An executive is likely to miss signs
	(D) Being heavily committed makes them likely to miss signs
	(E) Being heavily committed is likely to make an executive miss signs
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A), (C), (D), and (E) all contain logical meanings. Answer (B), though, is problematic. The <i>executive</i> doesn't <i>make</i> this phenomenon <i>likely</i> to happen; rather,<i>heavy commitment to a course of action makes it likely</i> that the <i>executive</i> will miss something. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X or Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The sentence contains the parallelism marker <i>or</i>. Check for the correct <i>X or Y</i> parallel structure.</p>
			<p>In answer (D), the sentence says <i>makes them likely to miss signs or misinterpreting them</i>. The <i>X</i> form is in the infinitive; the <i>Y</i> form is a participle. Eliminate answer (D) for lack of parallelism.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	<p>Correct answer (E) conveys an unambiguous meaning (the act of <i>being heavily committed</i> makes <i>an executive</i> likely <i>to miss</i> certain <i>signs</i>) and does not contain any ambiguous pronouns.</p>
	<p>Note: The correct answer ends up using the oft-maligned word <i>being</i>. Don't cross off an answer simply because it contains the word <i>being</i>!</p>

			<p>The <i>Anasazi</i> moved to a place where they had greater <i>access to water</i>. This portion of the sentence changes substantially among the answers; do they all convey an appropriate meaning?</p>

			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>they</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) contains the pronoun <i>they</i>. Who had less limited water access?</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>where they consist</i></b></p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the modifier <i>society where they consist</i> has two problems. First, <i>where</i> should introduce information about an actual location, but <i>society</i> is not a location. Second, the pronoun <i>they</i> must refer to the plural noun <i>wasps</i>, but it isn't logical to say that the individual <i>wasps consist</i> mostly <i>of females</i>. Rather, the <i>society</i> consists mostly of females.</p>
			<p>Answer (A) is wrong for both reasons listed above. Answers (B), (D), and (E) all contain the correct meaning. Answer (C) separates out <i>almost all females</i> by a comma; without any further linkage, these words don't clearly describe <i>society</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>

	An “-ing” modifier that is not separated out from the sentence by a comma is typically a noun modifier, referring to the noun right before it.
Correct answer (B) has this structure, properly indicating that the <i>society</i> as a whole consists mostly <i>of females</i>. Note that this answer sets a trap: it sounds odd to say <i>social wasps, wasps that live</i>. It is acceptable, though, to repeat the word <i>wasps</i> after the comma.

		<li>
			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>The subject of the original sentence is <i>El Niño</i>. What's the verb?</p>
			<p>There are various verb forms, but none can function as the main verb in the sentence. The verb <i>combine</i> is a part of the <i>in which</i> modifier, and <i>has accumulated</i> is part of the <i>that</i> modifier. <i>To flow</i> is in the infinitive; a main verb can't be in the infinitive. Answers (B) and (C) also do not contain a main verb. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>M odifier: <i>where</i></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the text <i>changes combine allowing water to flow</i>. There are two possibilities for the participle <i>allowing</i> directly following the verb <i>combine</i>:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	1. The participle could be a noun acting as the direct object of the verb: I like swimming.
	2. The participle could be part of a present progressive tense: She is driving to the store.
			</pre>	
			<p>Neither of the two possible structures fits <i>allowing</i> in this sentence, so answer (A) is wrong. The other answers change the structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) phenomenon where changes are combining to allow
	(C) phenomenon in which changes combine and which allows
	(D) phenomenon in which changes combine to allow
	(E) phenomenon where changes are combining and allow
			</pre>
			<p>The <i>to allow</i> structure in answers (B) and (D) is acceptable. In answers (C) and (E), <i>combine</i> and <i>allow</i> are now parallel and “separate but equal”; in other words, the second action no longer happens as a result of the first. This loss of meaning is not acceptable. Eliminate answers (A), (C), and (E).</p>
			<p>This comparison of the answers highlights another split: <i>in which</i> versus <i>where</i>. As a general rule, <i>where</i> should be used to modify a location; a <i>phenomenon</i>, though, is an event or circumstance, not a location. In this case, <i>in which</i> is the appropriate modifier structure. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>combining; accumulating</i></b></p>
			<p>Some answers use the simple present <i>combine</i>; others use the present progressive <i>are combining</i>. Similarly, some answers use <i>has</i> or <i>is accumulated</i> and some use <i>accumulating</i>.</p>
			<p>The sentence describes a <i>phenomenon</i> that occurs periodically (note the word <i>periodic</i> in the sentence), not something that occurs constantly or continuously. The <i>phenomenon</i> may not be occurring right now. The present progressive, then, is inappropriate. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the initial structure error by including a main verb: <i>El Niño is a phenomenon</i>. It also correctly changes the <i>combine allowing</i> portion to <i>combine to allow</i>.

		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier / Pronoun: <i>them</i></b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence contains two modifiers in a row, placed between the subject and the verb: <i>in her book illustrations, coordinating them with her narratives</i>. In various answers, these modifiers move around and sometimes change form. What refers to what?</p>
			<p>The modifier <i>in her book illustrations</i> refers to something that takes place within the illustrations. The pronoun in the next modifier,<i>carefully coordinating them</i>, refers back to the <i>book illustrations</i>. It's impossible for this coordination to take place within the actual illustrations themselves. Consider this example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

			<p>That sentence says: In her book, she coordinated her book with her blog. This is illogical! The coordination took place between the two separate items, not within the book.</p>
			<p>In the same way, Beatrix Potter coordinated her illustrations and her narratives, but this coordination did not take place literally within the illustrations themselves; rather, she coordinated between the two. Answers (A), (B), and (E) all contain this error; eliminate them.</p>

	(D) Coordinated with her narratives, Potter, in her book illustrations
			</pre>
			<p>Answer (D) says: <i>coordinated with her narratives, Beatrix Potter</i>.</p>

	Correct answer (C) fixes the initial ambiguity with the modifiers and also properly places the modifiers relative to the other parts of the sentence. The <i>which</i> modifier refers to the <i>book illustrations</i> modifier, and <i>in her illustrations</i> refers to Potter.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure <br>Pronoun: <i>it</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains the structure: <i>Marconi's conception of the radio was as X</i>. The other four answers all say that <i>Marconi conceived</i> something.</p>
			<p>The original sentence structure is an example of something called a nominalized noun: a verb (<i>to conceive</i>) has been turned into the noun form, and that noun is then paired with a verb that does not actually offer any action (<i>was</i>). While this structure is technically possible, it is not preferred. Because the remaining four answers all offer regular constructions (<i>Marconi conceived</i>), the correct answer is probably not (A).</p>
			<p>In addition, the pronoun <i>it</i> doesn't refer to <i>radio</i> as clearly as it should. In fact, the parallel positions of <i>conception</i> and <i>it</i> as subjects of the clauses before and after the semicolon, respectively, would suggest that <i>Marconi's conception is a tool for communicating</i>. This ambiguity is a second negative consequence of the nominalized noun. Together, these provide enough reason to eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>which</i><br>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Answers (B) and (D) change the semicolon into a noun modifier beginning with <i>which</i>. Answer (E) </p>
			<p>changes the structure even more substantially.</p>
			<p>It might be possible to write a correct sentence that uses a noun modifier for the second portion, but in this case, the <i>which</i> modifier appears to refer to the noun <i>telephone</i> in both answers (B) and (D). Logically, the second half of the sentence should refer to the <i>radio</i>, not the <i>telephone</i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (D).</p>
			<p>In answer (E), the second half of the sentence needs some kind of clear transition: a semicolon, a conjunction, even potentially a modifier structure. Answer (E), though, is unclear. What does <i>other than what it is</i> refer to? What is the meaning of the sequence <i>other than what it is, precisely the</i><i>opposite</i>? This ambiguity is bad; eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>conceive X to be Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The answers contain a split between <i>conceived as</i> in answers (A), (B), and (C) and <i>conceived to be</i> in answers (D) and (E).</p>
			<p>The correct idiom is to <i>conceive X as Y</i>, not to <i>conceive X to be Y</i>. Eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the issue in the original sentence by changing the noun <i>conception</i> to the verb <i>conceived</i>. <br><br> Note that the test writers set a trap in answer (C) via this sequence:<i>a tool for private conversation that could substitute for the telephone</i>. Under most circumstances, an essential <i>that</i> modifier needs to be placed immediately adjacent to the noun it modifies, <i>tool</i>, not another noun (<i>conversation</i>). It is acceptable, though, for the short descriptive phrase <i>for private conversation</i> to intervene because this description of the noun <i>tool</i> is necessary in order to understand the full meaning of the sentence.

	<div><b>Sentence Structure</b></div>
	<p>The original sentence is complex enough that it may be worth the time to deconstruct the sentence:</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><img align="middle" src="../../../assets/img/question/OG15-SC-106.png"/><p>
	<p>There are so many modifiers hanging off of the core sentence that this problem is almost certainly testing modifiers.</p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>called</i></b></p>
			<p>Once you suspect that modifiers are being tested, examine the sentence structure and answer choices with this in mind.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	What was <i>originally developed for</i> something? The technique. 
	What is <i>called proton-induced</i>…? The technique.
	What <i>can quickly analyze</i>…? Wow—once again, the technique!
			</pre>
			<p>Of the three modifiers referring to <i>technique</i>, only <i>called proton-induced X-ray emission</i> is an essential modifier and so should not be separated from <i>technique</i> by words or punctuation marks. Answer (A) correctly places the <i>called</i> modifier immediately adjacent to <i>technique</i> without any intervening punctuation. Scan the other answers for the placement of the <i>called</i> modifier:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) a technique called …
	(C) a technique…pollutants, called … 
	(D) a technique…pollutants, called … 
	(E) a technique…substance, called …
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) all separate <i>technique</i> from its essential modifier. In answers (C) and (D), it appears that the <i>air pollutants</i> are <i>called proton-induced X-ray emission</i>. In answer (E), it appears that the <i>substance</i> is called this name. Eliminate all three answers.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>having the ability</i></b></p>
			<p>After examining the essential modifier, look at the nonessential ones. The nonessential modifier <i>originally developed for detecting air pollutants</i> should be placed as close as possible to <i>technique</i>.</p>
			<p>Answers (A), (C), (D), and (E) all place <i>originally developed</i> as close as possible to <i>technique</i>. Answer (B), however, differs:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) originally developed for detecting air pollutants, having the ability to analyze,
			</pre>
			<p>The second part (<i>having</i>) appears to refer to the first part ( <i>originally</i>), but nothing in the first part has the ability to analyze anything; rather, the <i>technique</i> (which appears much later in the sentence) has the ability to do so. Eliminate answer (B) for bad modifier placement.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Although answer (A) does not place the <i>which</i> modifier immediately adjacent to <i>technique</i>, this answer is correct. The sentence contains three separate modifiers that refer to the same noun, <i>technique</i>. A single word can have only two sides on which modifiers can be placed (before and after), so one of the three modifiers cannot be placed immediately next to <i>technique</i>. Further, the essential modifier (<i>called</i>) must be placed right next to technique. As a result, the <i>which</i> modifier is placed further from technique; it modifies the entire phrase <i>a technique called proton-induced X-ray emission</i>.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>makes</i></b></p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the plural noun <i>costs</i> is the subject of the modifying clause <i>that makes it more expensive</i>. The verb <i>makes</i>, however, is singular.</p>
			<p>Check the remaining answers for the same subject–verb mismatch. Answer (C) repeats the original error: <i>costs…makes</i>. The other answers don't maintain this error. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>the same to do X as to do Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The five answer choices contain small differences in the comparison structure: (A) <i></p>
			<p>it costs about the same to run nuclear plants as other types of plants </i> </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) the cost of running nuclear plants is about the same as for other types of plants  
	(C) it costs about the same to run nuclear plants as for other types of plants  
	(D) it costs about the same to run nuclear plants as for other types of plants  
	(E) the cost of running nuclear plants is about the same as other types of plants
			</pre>
			<p>Each sentence requires the reader to carry some words of the comparison to both the <i>X</i> and the <i>Y</i> components. Answer (A) is properly parallel and maintains an appropriate meaning: <i>It costs the same to run X as</i> [<i>to run</i>] <i>Y</i>. Likewise, in answer (B), <i>the cost of running X is the same as</i> [<i>the cost</i>] <i>for</i> [<i>running</i>] <i>Y</i>.</p>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E), however, are problematic. Answers (C) and (D) indicate that <i>it costs the same to run X as [to run] for Y</i>. To run <i>for</i> plants? That's a big difference in meaning (and an illogical one). Answer (E) says that <i>the cost of running X is the same as the cost running Y</i>; the preposition (either <i>of</i> or <i>for</i>) is missing from the second part. Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>		
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Pronoun: <i>it; they</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses the pronoun <i>it</i> three times. Are all three instances clear, and do they refer to the same noun?</p>
			<p>In the first instance, <i>it</i> is used as a dummy pronoun, as in the sentence “It is raining outside.” This is an acceptable usage of <i>it</i>. Each additional instance of the word <i>it</i> in the sentence is also a dummy pronoun, but each refers to somewhat different abstract ideas. Such ambiguity is not preferred. Don't choose answer (A) unless all of the other answers contain clear errors.</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) also introduce some ambiguity related to a pronoun. Both introduce <i>nuclear plants</i> versus <i>other power plants</i> and then use the word <i>they</i>. It's not clear until finishing the sentence that the pronoun <i>they</i> is intended to refer to the <i>nuclear plants</i> and not to the <i>other power plants</i>. Again, don't choose answer (D) or (E) unless all of the other answers contain clear errors.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) offers a proper subject–verb pairing and a structure that accurately compares the two sets of costs. Furthermore, answer (B) doesn't contain even slight pronoun ambiguity.

			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>It turns out that (A) is the correct answer on this problem, so you may not spot a starting point when reading the original sentence. Read answer (B) next and, because the whole sentence is underlined, try to strip the sentence down to the core structure:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) Parents who are more likely to have children that are X, Y, and Z .
			</pre>
			<p>Answer (B) has a subject (<i>parents</i>), but no main verb. The first instance of the verb <i>are</i> is part of the modifier <i>who are more likely</i>, and the second instance is part of the modifier <i>that are self-confident</i>. Eliminate answer (B) because it is a sentence fragment.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Comparison: <i>X rather than Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence makes a comparison between <i>authoritative</i> and <i>permissive parents</i>. Check the comparison in other answer choices.</p>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (D) compare the two types of parents. What's going on in answer (C)?</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	Is it this?
	(C) <i style="color: blue;">Children of</i> authoritative parents <i style="color: blue;">rather than</i> permissive parents 
	Or this?
	(C) Children <i style="color: blue;">of authoritative parents rather than</i> permissive parents
			</pre>
			<p>The sentence is ambiguous: It could compare the two types of <i>parents</i>, but it could also compare the <i>children</i> of one type of parent to the <i>permissive parents</i>.The wording in answer (E) definitely compares permissive parents to the children of other parents: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(E) Rather than <i style="color: red;">permissive parents, the children</i> of authoritative parents
			</pre>
			<p>Eliminate answer (C) for ambiguity and answer (E) for an illogical comparison.</p>

	(E) to have self-confidence, a high self-esteem, and to be independent
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (C), (D), and (E) all break parallelism. Answer (C) needs a <i>to</i> either before all three items or before only the first one. Answers (D) and (E) use verbs for the first and third items but not for the second. Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>they</i></b></p>
			<p>The pronoun <i>they</i> is plural; the noun <i>adolescent</i> is singular.</p>
			<p>The sentence does previously mention <i>children</i>, so the plural pronoun <i>they</i> is acceptable in that sense. However, the plural <i>children</i> would agree better with the plural <i>adolescents</i> than it does with the singular <i>adolescent</i>. Eliminate answer (D).</p>

			<p>Wait, who made his reputation—was it Owen or Randolph? Or maybe it was both of them?</p>
			<p>The pronoun <i>his</i> is singular, but the two people are connected by the word <i>and</i>, so the <i>who</i> modifier afterwards should apply to both of them.

			<p>Compare the beginnings of each answer vertically. Answers (B) and (C) insert the conjunction <i>and</i>, turning the “comma -ing” modifier into an independent clause.</p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the fact that the mutual fund invests in so many different companies results in the fact that the fund holds only a very small share of each company.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence contains a double-verb structure to go with the main noun: <i>Construction began</i>… [<i>construction</i>] <i>was completed</i>. Two verbs mapped to one subject require a conjunction, such as <i>and</i>, in between the two verbs: <i>Construction began</i>…<i>and was completed</i>.</p>
			<p>Answer (A) is incorrect due to the missing conjunction; compare the remaining answers: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) Construction begun and was completed
	(C) Construction began and was completed 
	(D) Construction, it was completed
	(E) Construction, which was begun and was completed
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (B) and (C) do insert the conjunction <i>and</i> between the two verbs. (You might spot another issue here. See the Verb issue below!) Answers (D) and (E) both change the structure more significantly.</p>
			<p>Answer (D) still contains the main verb <i>was completed</i> but inserts a second subject beforehand, <i>it</i>. A double-subject structure requires a conjunction between the two subjects; that conjunction is missing here. (Plus, if there are two subjects, they should be different things. It's not correct to say “Tina and she went to the store” when “she” refers to Tina!) </p>
			<p>In answer (E), both verbs are part of the new <i>which</i> modifier: <i>which was begun…and [which] was completed</i>. No main verb exists in the sentence! Eliminate answers (A), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>begun</i></b></p>
			<p>You might spot this when examining the structure issues discussed above. Answer choice (B) tries to use a double-verb structure: <i>Construction begun…and was completed</i>.</p>
			<p><i>Begun</i> is the past participle of the verb to begin. A participle can't be a main verb by itself; it has to be combined with another verb form. For example: The construction has begun. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) repairs the initial structure error by inserting the conjunction <i>and</i> between the two parallel main verbs: <i>Construction began in A.D. 69 and was completed later</i>.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it</i></b></p>
			<p>There are two instances of the pronoun <i>it</i> in the sentence. Check them.</p>
			<p>In the first case, <i>it would be rated</i> refers to the <i>vision</i> (not the <i>baby</i>—a baby's <i>vision</i> is rated, not the actual <i>baby</i>). The second <i>it</i> must be referring to the <i>baby</i>: <i>if it</i> (the baby) <i>were an adult</i>. Mismatch! The same pronoun can't refer to two different things in the same sentence. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Of the other answers, only answer (C) also uses the pronoun <i>it</i> and, in that case, the pronoun usage is fine.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>This subtle issue will likely only be spotted when reading answer choice (B) in full. (There's a good chance answer (B) will be one of your last answers standing.) </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) A baby emerges with a sense of vision that would be rated 20/500, or legally blind as an adult.
			</pre>
			<p><i>Legally blind as an adult</i> isn't a full sentence, so it must be a modifier. What is it modifying? Logically, the sentence is trying to say that an adult with 20/500 vision would be considered legally blind. Consider this example: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	A mouse emerges from its hole with its whiskers quivering frantically, or ___________.
			</pre>
			<p>Fill in that blank. What kind of information would you expect to see? The sentence sets up the expectation that it's going to tell us something else about the whiskers quivering frantically, perhaps something like: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	A mouse emerges from its hole with its whiskers quivering frantically, or twitching at really high speed.
			</pre>
			<p>That information after the comma provides additional information about the last thing that was said before the comma. In answer choice (B), though, it doesn't make sense to say that the rating, or even the <i>sense of vision</i>, is <i>legally blind as an adult</i>. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (D) contain a semicolon; test the structure.</p>
			<p>In answer (C), the part before the semicolon, <i>As a baby…about 20/500</i>, is a complete sentence. The part after the semicolon, <i>qualifying it to be legally blind if an adult</i>, is not a complete sentence. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
			<p>In answer (D), both the part before and the part after the semicolon are complete sentences.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>would deemed</i></b></p>
			<p>This issue is a tough one to spot. The <i>which</i> modifier reads:<i>sense of vision, which would deemed legally blind for an adult</i>.</p>
			<p>What is this portion of the sentence referring to? A comma followed by <i>which</i> indicates a noun modifier, so <i>which would deemed</i> is referring to the <i>sense of vision</i>.</p>
			<p>A person can deem something: The CEO deemed (or considered) it necessary to institute layoffs. A <i>sense of vision</i>, however, cannot <i>deem</i> (active voice) anything. Rather, the sentence would have to say that a <i>sense of vision would be deemed</i> (passive voice) <i>legally blind</i>. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the original pronoun error by removing all instances of the pronoun <i>it</i>. It does also change the structure somewhat (by inserting a semicolon), but the change is made correctly.

		<li>
			<p><b>Pronouns: <i>it; they</i><br>Parallelism: <i>if X then Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains this piece: <i>If one arm is lost it quickly replaces it</i>. Check the pronouns.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) if one arm is lost… 	(then) it quickly replaces it 
	(B) if one arm is lost… 	(then) it is quickly replaced 
	(C) if they lose one arm… 	(then) they quickly replace it 
	(D) if they lose one arm… 	(then) they are quickly replaced
	(E) if they lose one arm… 	(then) it is quickly replaced
			</pre>
			<p>If one sentence uses the same pronoun to refer to two different things, the sentence is considered ambiguous—and therefore wrong. In answer (A), the first <i>it</i> refers to <i>starfish</i>; the second refers to <i>one arm</i>.</p>
			<p>Notice, too, that the noun <i>starfish</i> could be singular or plural. Which is it in this sentence? Check out the verb: <i>starfish have</i>. He have? Or they have? <i>They have</i> is correct, so starfish is plural. The pronoun <i>it</i> is singular, another reason to eliminate (A). Check the remaining answers for both pronoun ambiguity and singular versus plural.</p>
			<p>Answer (D) also contains the double pronoun error. The first instance of the plural pronoun <i>they</i> refers to the <i>starfish</i>, while the second refers to <i>one arm</i> (which is also a number mismatch— <i>one arm</i> is singular). Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
			<p>This examination also highlights the parallelism required for the idiom <i>if X (then) Y</i>. (Note: The word “then” is optional; this problem doesn't use it.) When <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are in the form of clauses, the entire clauses should be parallel. A subject pronoun in the second clause should refer to the subject of the first clause. Eliminate answers (A), (D), and (E) for failing to do so.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The original sentence indicates that <i>starfish</i> can regenerate an arm, though they sometimes <i>overcompensate</i> and grow extra arms:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A), (C): by overcompensating and growing an extra one
	(B), (D), (E): with the animal overcompensating and growing an extra one
			</pre>
			<p>In answers (A) and (C), the preposition <i>by</i> means that the starfish replaces the arm <i>by</i> <i>overcompensating</i>. The meaning is illogical; the first arm grown is not an overcompensation; rather, the first one is the intended replacement arm. Only the <i>extra</i> arms represent overcompensation—and the extras, by definition, are not the replacement arm. The other choices use the preposition <i>with</i> instead of <i>by</i>, avoiding the meaning error. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) employs a properly parallel structure with clear pronoun usage: <i>If one arm is lost it is quickly replaced</i>. This choice also correctly uses <i>with</i> to introduce the extra information that the animal sometimes accidentally grows extra arms.

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>they; this</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence begins with an opening modifier followed by a main clause: <i>Because there are provisions, they have stimulated</i>. To which noun does the pronoun <i>they</i> refer?</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) Because there are provisions…areas, they have stimulated disputes 
	(B) Because the code provides that…areas, it has stimulated disputes 
	(C) Even tiny islets can be…code, already stimulating disputes
	(D) Because tiny islets can be…code, this has stimulated disputes
	(E) Because tiny islets can be…code, which is already stimulating disputes
			</pre>
			<p>
			Answers (A), (B), and (D) all use an opening modifier followed by a main clause. In this structure, when a pronoun is the subject of the main clause, the expectation is that the pronoun refers to the opening modifier—ideally, the main noun of that modifier.<p/>
			<p>In answer (A), the main noun <i>there</i> can't be the antecedent for <i>they</i>. The rest of the modifier contains multiple possibilities: the <i>provisions</i>, the <i>islets</i>, the <i>claims</i>. Ambiguity is bad; eliminate answer (A.</p>
			<p>The subject pronoun <i>it</i> in answer (B) does logically refer to <i>code</i>, the main noun in the opening modifier. Answer (B) is okay.</p>
			Answer (D) changes the subject pronoun of the main clause to <i>this</i>. When the pronoun <i>this</i> is the subject of a sentence, it cannot refer to a noun or situation in the same clause or to a modifier attached to that clause. An example of correct usage:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	She is allergic to many foods; this makes it difficult for her to eat at restaurants.
			</pre>
			<p>The example above is correct because <i>this</i> refers to a situation described in a different independent clause. In answer (D), however, the word <i>this</i> refers to the situation described in the attached modifier. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
			<p>Note that answers (C) and (E) change the structure significantly; examine this issue next.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Modifier: <i>which; stimulating</i><br>Meaning: <i>sea areas under provisions</i></b></p>
			<p>As noted above, answers (C) and (E) change the structure.</p>
			<p>The portions after the comma in answers (C) and (E) have transformed from main clauses into modifiers:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(C) Even tiny islets can be the basis for claims, already stimulating disputes.
	(E) Because tiny islets can be the basis for claims, which is already stimulating disputes.
			</pre>
			<p>A sentence isn't a sentence without a main clause somewhere! Answer (C) does have an independent clause before the comma, but answer (E) does not. Eliminate answer (E) because it is a sentence fragment.</p>
			<p>Answer (C) inserts a participle modifier, <i>stimulating</i>. This modifier should refer to <i>islets can be the basis</i>, but logic dictates that the <i>code</i> is <i>stimulating disputes</i>, not the <i>islets</i>. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
			<p>Finally, answers (C), (D), and (E) create an illogical meaning with the structure <i>sea areas under provisions of the new code</i>. The <i>provisions</i> are not literally <i>under</i>, or even a part of, the <i>sea areas</i>. Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) fixes the initial pronoun error by changing the subject of the opening modifier to match the pronoun used as the subject of the main clause: <i>Because the code provides</i> something, <i>it</i> (the code) <i>has stimulated disputes</i>.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Parallelism: <i>X and then Y</i></b></p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the <i>members made payments, then taking turns drawing</i>. Some sort of sequence of events exists, but it's a bit difficult to understand. The First Glance revealed that the other four answers all change the word <i>then</i> to <i>and</i>; would this make the sentence easier to understand?</p>
			<p>Yes! First the members made payments, <i>and</i> then <i>took turns</i> doing something else. Answer (A) doesn't make this parallel relationship clear because it's missing the conjunction <i>and</i>.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, the implied parallelism means the <i>members made payments</i> and the members then <i>took turns</i> doing something, but answer (A) says the <i>members made, then</i> [ <i>the members</i>] <i>taking turns</i>. <i>Taking</i> isn't the right form of the verb; it should be <i>took</i>. Answer (B) does insert the parallelism marker <i>and</i> but continues to use the incorrect participle form <i>taking</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Because structure has already been tested once, with the missing <i>and</i> in answer (A), examine the remaining answers with this in mind. Answers (C), (D), and (E) are all parallel, but what happens with the remaining portion of the construction?</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(C) members made payments and <span style="color: green;">took turns drawing</span> on the funds. 
	(D) members made payments and <span style="color: red;">took turns, they drew</span> on the funds. 
	(E) members made payments and <span style="color: red;">drew, taking turns</span> on the funds.
			</pre>
			<p>Answer (C) ends on one complete thought: <i>took turns drawing</i>. Answer (D) splits out the last portion as its own independent clause: <i>they drew on the funds</i>. It is incorrect to connect an independent </p>
			<p>clause to another portion of the sentence without some kind of conjunction or a semicolon. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) splits up the actions. It's no longer clear what the members are <i>drawing</i>, nor do you know what they're <i>taking turns</i> doing. Although you may know the intended meaning based upon the original sentence, this choice does not actually indicate what the members took turns doing. Eliminate answer (E).</p>

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>hypothesis of</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence introduces the description of a <i>hypothesis</i> with the words <i>of there being different functions</i> (in different locations).</p>
			<p>If the description of the <i>hypothesis</i> includes a verb, then the proper idiom is <i>hypothesis that</i> + clause. For example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	The restaurant manager has a <i>hypothesis that</i> people will tip better when the weather is good.
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) both use the construction <i>hypothesis of</i>; eliminate them.</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) change the construction by placing a <i>which</i> modifier directly after <i>hypothesis</i>. Such a construction might work; see the Modifier discussion for more.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier / Meaning </b></p>
			<p>You'd spot this one either when noticing the original idiom error or when comparing the beginning of each answer choice. Is it acceptable to use a <i>which</i> modifier at this location?</p>
			<p><i>Which</i> modifiers are nonessential and are typically separated from the rest of the sentence by commas. It's possible, in rare circumstances, to use <i>which</i> as an essential modifier without commas, but the word <i>that</i> is preferred when introducing such a construction.</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) don't use commas, so both would have to be interpreted as essential modifiers. The meaning of answer (E), then, changes: the sentence is referring to the one hypothesis (of all of Gall's hypotheses) that is widely accepted today; the original sentence never indicates that only one of Gall's hypotheses is widely accepted today. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>Compare answer (D) to answer (C):</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(C) Gall's hypothesis that functions are localized is accepted.
	(D) Gall's hypothesis which is that there are functions localized is accepted.
			</pre>
			<p>The test writers prefer to use <i>that</i> to introduce an essential modifier. Eliminate answer (D).</p>
		</li>

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the initial idiom error by replacing the word <i>of</i> with the word <i>that</i>. Further, the word <i>that</i> is an appropriate choice because this portion of the sentence is an essential modifier.

			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) Mauritius was a colony, the English language was never spoken.

			<p>The <i>Y</i> portion of this structure should not be introduced with <i>to be</i> or <i>as</i> or any other expression. Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) all insert unnecessary words between the <i>X</i> ( <i>the rural poor</i>) and <i>Y</i> (<i>legitimate subjects</i>). Eliminate all four.</p>

			<p>The original sentence says <i>caused…in burning fossil fuels</i>.</p>
			<p><i>In burning</i> is an incorrect idiom. Possible correct alternatives for this sentence include <i>when burning</i> or <i>while burning</i>, indicating that the cause occurs when or while human beings take a certain action. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>that</i></b></p>
			<p>You would probably only notice this difference when comparing answers directly: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) a phenomenon most scientists agree that is caused
	(C) a phenomenon that most scientists agree is caused
			</pre>
			<p>The modifier beginning <i>a phenomenon</i> has a complex structure. The simpler version would be:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	a phenomenon that is caused by (something) 
			</pre>
			<p>The author wants to introduce further support by indicating that most scientists agree with this assessment. In this type of construction, the <i>scientists agree</i> portion should be placed between <i>that</i> and <i>is</i>: <i>that most scientists agree is</i>. Answer (C) does this correctly. Eliminate answer (B).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) change up the meaning:</p>

	(E) which scientists agree to be a phenomenon caused by fuels burned by human beings  </span>
			</pre>
Consider these examples:
<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color: green;">Bjorn and Jim agree on this topic. </span>
	<span style="color: red;">Bjorn and Jim agree on as a topic.</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The second is confusing. They agree that the topic exists? They are in agreement about something to do with the topic? Answer (D) says that <i>scientists agree on</i> global warming <i>as a phenomenon</i>, but really they <i>agree</i> about the <i>cause</i> of the <i>phenomenon</i>; that meaning is lost in this answer.</p>
			<p>Further, the direct cause is not the people themselves, nor is it the existence of the <i>fuels</i>. The cause is the <i>burning</i> of the <i>fuels</i>. This meaning is obscured in both answers (D) and (E); eliminate them.</p>
		</li>

<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the original verb error by replacing <i>to be</i> with the present tense <i>is</i>. The authors likely used the awkward but correct construction <i>human beings’ burning of fossil fuels</i> in order to tempt people to cross off the correct answer.

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>splitting</i></b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence could be read in one of two ways:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	Impacts may have caused (W) reversals, (X) the onset, (Y) splitting, and (Z) eruptions.
	Impacts may have caused (J) reversals, (K) the onset, (modifier) splitting continents, and (L) eruptions.
			</pre>
			<p>Is the <i>splitting</i> portion the third item in a list of four? Or is it a modifier providing extra information about <i>the onset of ice ages</i>?</p>
			<p>Ambiguity in general is bad, so the initial sentence can't be correct. As a general rule, the test writers don't like to make action nouns (such as <i>reversals</i>, <i>onset</i>, and <i>eruptions</i>) parallel to simple gerunds (such as <i>splitting</i>) because this pairing can result in the ambiguity outlined above. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
			<p>Note: Answer (B) also contains <i>splitting</i>, but includes the article <i>the</i> in front. <i>The splitting</i> is a complex gerund and it is acceptable to make a complex gerund parallel to an action noun.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Parallelism </b></p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) focus on the action of <i>splitting</i> something. Answers (C), (D), and (E) focus on a description of the noun <i>continents</i>. Are both acceptable in the context of the sentence?</p>
			<p>The non-underlined portions list nouns that were <i>caused</i> by the <i>impacts</i>: <i>reversals</i> of something, the <i>onset</i> of something else, and <i>volcanic eruptions</i>. Would these impacts have caused the action of <i>splitting</i>? Or would these impacts have caused the <i>continents</i> themselves?</p>
			<p>It's possible that the impacts might have caused the formation of the continents or something similar, but it's illogical to say that the <i>impacts caused the continents</i>. Caused them to exist? In that case, the sentence would need to say something such as “impacts created the continents.” Eliminate answers (C), (D), and (E).</p>
			<p>The beginning of answer (C) could also be interpreted as a verb, <i>split</i>. If that were the case, however, then the list would not be parallel, as the other three items are all nouns. Either way, answer (C) is incorrect.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (B) fixes the initial ambiguity by changing the simple gerund <i>splitting</i> to the complex gerund <i>the splitting</i>. Further, <i>the splitting</i> is an action noun, properly parallel to the other action nouns in the list.

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>from</i></b></p>
			<p>What, exactly, is <i>from a one-page writing sample?</i> The original sentence seems to indicate that the firm claims something from the sample.</p>
			<p>It's certainly possible to claim something from an essay or some other written document, but this interpretation doesn't match the full sentence. Rather, <i>from a one-page writing sample</i> explains how the firm is able to assess personality traits. This modifier should be placed closer to <i>assess</i>, as it is in answers (C), (D), and (E). Eliminate answers (A) and (B) for conveying the illogical meaning that the claim is contained in the writing sample itself.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>claims it; claims the ability; claims being able</i></b></p>
			<p>The answers offer several variations of this idiom:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) A firm claims from a sample that it can assess 
	(B) A firm claims from a sample it has the ability 
	(C) A firm claims the ability
	(D) A firm claims to be able
	(E) A firm claims being able
			</pre>
			<p>
			The word <i>claims</i>, when followed by an action or event, can be used correctly in two primary ways:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	Claim that: She <i style="color: green;">claims that</i> her handwriting is beautiful.
	Claim + infinitive: She <i style="color: green;">claims to</i> write beautifully.
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A) and (D) both use an acceptable idiom. Answers (B), (C), and (E) do not; eliminate them.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>ability of</i></b></p>
			<p>Several answer choices introduce the phrase <i>the ability of assessing</i>.</p>
			<p><i>The ability of</i> doing something is an incorrect idiom. Eliminate answers (B) and (C) for using this construction.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (D) fixes the initial meaning error by placing the <i>from</i> modifier later in the sentence and also separating that modifier out using commas. This choice clearly indicates that the firm <i>claims to be able to assess</i> something based upon <i>the writing sample</i>.

	<p style="text-align: center;"><img align="middle" src="../../../assets/img/question/OG15-SC-123.png"/><p>
	There are two different parallel structures interwoven into the second half:
	<pre class="compare-group">

	Second: <i style="color: blue;">consumption of (M) alcohol and of (N) wine</i>

	<p>Although the sentence seems very convoluted, the parallelism is actually 100% correct.</p>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Modifier: <i>red wine</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (B) says <i>a moderate alcohol consumption, particularly red wine</i>. What is <i>red wine</i> describing? Answer (D) has a similar structure.</p>
			<p>In answer (B), <i>red wine</i> is describing the main noun before it—<i>consumption</i>. <i>Red wine</i> is not an example of <i>consumption</i>, a type of <i>consumption</i>, or in any way a description of <i>consumption</i>; the meaning is illogical. Rather, <i>red wine</i> is a type of <i>alcohol</i>. Answer (D) repeats this error; eliminate both (B) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning / Parallelism </b></p>
			<p>Answers (C) and (E) both use the parallel marker <i>and</i>:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(C) moderate alcohol consumption, and particularly of red wine
	(E) consumption in a report and in particular red wine
			</pre>
			<p>In answer (C), <i>of red wine</i> doesn't have a parallel “of + noun” match. Logically, the noun <i>wine</i> should match with <i>alcohol</i>, but <i>alcohol</i> is an adjective in this sentence. Answer (E) also doesn't have a parallel match. The structure <i>in a 1991 report</i>, appearing just before <i>and in particular red wine</i>, appears to try to make those two items parallel, but it's illogical to make <i>report</i> and <i>wine</i> parallel. Eliminate answers (C) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>in a 1991 report</i></b></p>
			<p>When time markers, such as <i>in a 1991 report</i>, move around, there is likely a Meaning issue.</p>
			<p>The <i>1991 report linked</i> two items (<i>modest consumption</i> and <i>a reduced risk</i>). This time marker has to point to the linking action and not another action. In answers (A), (B), and (D), the time marker is very close to the <i>linked</i> action. Answers (C) and (E), however, have issues.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color: red;">(C) in a 1991 report, moderate consumption…caused them to begin to grow.</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The time marker is attached to the main clause; the <i>consumption caused</i> something <i>to grow in the report</i> itself.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color: red;">(E) a reduced risk linked to modest consumption in a 1991 report…</span>
			</pre>
			<p>Again, although you might know logically what the sentence is trying to say, answer (E) actually says that the <i>consumption</i> occurred <i>in the 1991 report</i>. Eliminate answers (C) and (E) for conveying illogical meanings.</p>

			<p><b>Comparison: <i>less successful</i></b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence contains a comparison marker: <i>less successful</i>.</p>
			<p>There are two problems with <i>she was less successful compared to Germany</i>. First, the correct idiom is <i>less successful than</i> but the <i>than</i> is missing in this case. Second, it's illogical to compare a person or a person's success to Germany. Scan the other answers for either of these errors:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(B) less successful 			<span style="color: red;">as</span> compared to Germany
	(C) less successful 			<span style="color: green;">than</span> she had been in Germany

			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>The original connects two independent clauses with a comma:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	She was less successful, Lotte Jacobi earned a small group.
			</pre>
			<p>Two independent sentences must be connected either by some kind of conjunction (such as “and”) or by a semicolon. Neither is the case here, so this is a run-on sentence. Answer (E) repeats this structure; eliminate both answers (A) and (E).</p>

			<p>The verb tenses change throughout the answers. What is the sequence of events?</p>
			<p>Lotte Jacobi is <i>native</i> to <i>Germany</i> and <i>emigrated</i> to <i>New York</i>. Therefore, she was in Germany first and later went to New York.</p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) both say that she was <i>less successful after she had emigrated to New York</i>. First, she emigrated; then, she had less success. It's acceptable to use past perfect to refer to emigration, the earlier of the two events. Answer (C) says that she was <i>less successful after she emigrated than she had been in Germany</i>. This is also acceptable, as she was in Germany first.</p>
			<p>In contrast, answer (E) says that <i>she had been less successful after</i> (<i>going to New York</i>) <i>than in Germany</i>. Her success in New York occurred later, so it cannot take past perfect in this construction. Eliminate answer (E).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>has</i></b></p>
			<p>The initial sentence makes a comparison between something happening <i>today</i> and something that happened <i>in 1910</i>. The 1910 portion uses a present tense verb, <i>has</i>.</p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (C) incorrectly use the present tense verb <i>has</i> to refer to an action that took place more than 100 years ago. The remaining answers all properly use past tense verbs to discuss the past time frame. Eliminate answers (A) and (C).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Modifier: <i>much</i><br>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>The form of the comparison changes substantially:</p>

		(A) double the apples
		(B) twice as many apples
		(C) as much as twice the apples 
		(D) two times as many apples 
		(E) a doubling of the apples
			</pre>
			<p>The sentence is trying to compare the number of apples produced in 1910 to the number of apples produced today (via the same amount of acreage). The original wording (<i>double</i>) isn't great, but it's not outright incorrect either. Answer (B) is also acceptable. Answer (C) uses the comparison marker <i>as much as</i>, but the number of apples is countable. <i>Much</i> is used for uncountable quantities: there is much water, but there are many apples. Eliminate answer (C).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) says, in effect, that the <i>acreage produces a doubling of the</i> actual <i>apples that</i> this acreage <i>produced in 1910</i>. The actual apples from 1910 no longer exist; rather, the <i>number</i> of apples <i>produced</i> doubled. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>The first portion of answer (D), <i>two times as many</i>, is acceptable, but examine the rest of the structure. The wording <i>as there were in 1910</i> refers to the number of apples in existence in general in 1910, not the number produced on a certain amount of acreage. It would be pretty amazing if a limited amount of acreage today could produce twice as many apples as existed everywhere in the world in 1910! Eliminate answer (D).</p>

			<p>Answers (A) and (B) are almost identical. Answer (A) uses the plural <i>create</i> while answer (B) uses the singular <i>creates</i>.</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>in turn</i></b></p>
			<p>Answers (A) and (B) also differ in one other way: the placement of the phrase <i>in turn</i>. What is this information describing?</p>
			<p>The phrase <i>in turn</i> illustrates a series of events: <i>X</i> causes <i>Y</i> and <i>Y</i>, in turn, causes <i>Z</i>. <i>In turn</i>, then, is best placed to show that the second event causes the third one: <i>Lying</i> (<i>X</i>) <i>produces reactions</i> (<i>Y</i>) and those <i>reactions</i>, <i>in turn</i>, <i>create responses</i> ( <i>Z</i>). Answer (B) moves <i>in turn</i> to the end of the sentence, after <i>responses</i>, creating an ambiguity: the original meaning could hold, or it could be the case that the <i>responses</i> then do something <i>in turn</i>.

	(D) reactions in an individual <span style="color: red;">to create</span> responses
	(E) reactions in an individual <span style="color: red;">who creates</span> responses
			</pre>
			<p>A noun followed by the word <i>that</i> typically signals a noun modifier. In this case, the construction is tricky. The closest noun, <i>individual</i>, is a modifier of the main noun, <i>reactions</i>.</p>
			<p>The <i>that</i> modifier, then, refers to the main noun <i>reactions</i>, not to the modifier <i>individual</i>. Answers (A) and (B) are acceptable.</p>
			<p>Answer (C) changes the first word to <i>creating</i>. A participle that is not separated out from the main clause by a comma describes the noun to which it is directly attached. Consider this alternate sentence:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	An earthquake will result in instability for a person hopping on one foot. 
			</pre>
			<p>The instability isn't hopping on one foot; the person is.</p>
			<p>In answers (C) and (E), both modifiers refer to the <i>individual</i>, not the <i>responses</i>. In this construction, the reactions occur only in individuals who have been creating unconscious physiological responses for some other reason. This meaning is nonsensical; rather, the reaction to lying then creates the unconscious responses. Eliminate answers (C) and (E). (Note: This issue is very subtle; most people miss it.) </p>
			<p>Answer (D) uses the infinitive <i>to create</i>. An infinitive verb used during a discussion of causation implies that one thing was done on purpose in order to cause another thing to happen. It is illogical to suggest that <i>lying produces emotional reactions</i> on purpose in order to <i>create unconscious physiological responses</i>. Eliminate answer (D).</p>

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (A) employs an appropriate modifier signal (<i>that</i>) to refer to the main noun <i>reactions</i>. Further, the phrase <i>in turn</i> is suitably placed near the follow-on action that occurred as part of a sequence.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>X and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>In the original sentence, the word <i>and</i> signals a parallelism or structure issue of some type: <i>X and Y</i>.</p>
			<p>The conjunction <i>and</i> could serve as the connection between two independent clauses, but <i>its trunk evolving</i> is not independent. Alternately, <i>and</i> could signal a dependent portion that is parallel to some other part of the sentence. However, nothing earlier in the sentence is parallel to <i>its trunk evolving</i>.</p>
			<p>Scan the remaining answers in the same location. Answers (B) and (C) both remove the <i>and</i>. Answers (D) and (E) both use the form <i>X and Y</i>, where the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions are parallel. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>has suggested; had descended</i></b></p>
			<p>A comparison of the beginning of each answer reveals several changes to the initial verb <i>suggests: has suggested, suggesting, or to suggest</i>.</p>
			<p>A switch from the construction <i>evidence that suggests</i> to the construction <i>evidence that has suggested</i> changes the meaning.<i>Suggests</i> implies that the suggestion will continue to be true. <i>Has suggested</i> indicates only that it was once true. The other variations (<i>suggesting</i>, <i>to suggest</i>) all acceptably convey the same meaning as the original construction. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
			<p>Because one verb form had an error, check for other verb issues. The verb <i>is descended</i> changes to <i>descended</i> or <i>had descended</i> in various choices. Both the simple past <i>descended</i> and the present <i>is descended</i> are acceptable. However, correct usage of the past perfect <i>had descended</i> requires a separate event or time marker at a more recent time in the past. The only other verb in the same clause of the sentence is <i>evolved</i>. This evolution was a part of the transition from aquatic animal to elephant; it did not occur afterwards. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure </b></p>
			<p>Answer (C) changes the <i>and</i> connector to the preposition <i>with</i>, followed by a complete sentence ( <i>its trunk originally evolved as a kind of snorkel</i>).</p>
			<p>Two complete sentences must be connected by some kind of conjunction, such as <i>and</i>, or by a semicolon; the preposition <i>with</i> is not acceptable. This would be the equivalent of writing “The elephant is gray with its trunk is long” (incorrect) as opposed to “The elephant is gray, and its trunk is long.” Eliminate answer (C).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (E) contains proper parallelism between the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> elements: <i>that the elephant is descended…and that its trunk evolved</i>.

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Subject–Verb: <i>has; is</i></b></p>
			<p>The underline contains the verb <i>has been added</i>; what subject goes with this verb?</p>
			<p>The original sentence contains an unusual inverted sentence structure. Normally, the subject comes before the verb. In this case, however, the subject <i>words</i> appears after the verb: <i>words has been added</i>. While inverted sentences can be correct in general, they still have to follow subject–verb agreement rules; a plural subject can't be paired with a singular verb. Answer (B) repeats this error: <i>words is added</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>is; are</i></b></p>
			<p>A comparison of the answers reveals a mix of verb tenses: present perfect (<i>has been, have been</i>) and present (<i>is, are</i>).</p>
			<p>The development of the <i>Cajun dialect</i> began in the past. Any discussion of that development, then, should use either past or present perfect. Simple present tense refers only to today; it can't apply to the past. Eliminate answers (B) and (E).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>A comparison of the beginning of each choice exposes a challenging split: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) to which has been added English words
	(B) added to which is English words
	(C) to which English words have been added
	(D) with English words having been added
	(E) and, in addition, English words are added
			</pre>
			<p>The pronoun <i>which</i> and the preposition <i>with</i> both signal modifiers. The word <i>and</i> indicates parallelism.</p>
			<p>Let's take the <i>and</i> case first. When two independent clauses are connected by the word <i>and</i>, those two clauses are considered separate things: Lucia is tall, and Bjorn likes cats. The two halves are not required to refer to each other at all.</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(E) Their language is French and words are added.
			</pre>
			<p>Those <i>words are added</i> to…what? The sentence doesn't actually say. Further, <i>in addition</i> is redundant when the phrase immediately follows the word <i>and</i>. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>What about <i>which</i> versus <i>with</i>? This gets tricky. <i>To which</i> is required to refer to the main noun immediately beforehand (<i>French</i> in this case); however, the preposition <i>with</i> is more flexible. Look at these two sentences:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	I'll have my pie with ice cream. 
	I'll have the pie with the apples.
			</pre>
			<p>The first one is talking about having something along with the pie: Can you please add ice cream on the side? The second is talking about a specific characteristic inherent in the pie: No, I don't want the cherry pie. I want the one with the apples.</p>
			<p>If <i>with</i> is used, is the sentence trying to indicate that the English, Spanish, and Italian words exist alongside of the French? Or that those words have been incorporated into the 17th-century French? Logically, it should be the latter, but technically the meaning is ambiguous.</p>

<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) repairs the initial subject–verb agreement error while maintaining the noun modifier construction that most clearly signifies the logical meaning: The words were added to the 17th-century French language.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>while</i></b></p>
			<p>While is the first word underlined, so there must be at least one difference in the answers. The word <i>while</i> has two primary meanings: <i>simultaneously with</i> or <i>although</i>. Which is it in this case?</p>
			<p>The meaning of <i>while</i> is ambiguous in answer (A). It would make the most sense for the sentence to indicate a contrast: It's one way in France and another way in Germany. It's possible, though, that the sentence is trying to indicate that something is a certain percentage in France while at the same time it's something else in Germany. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>it</i><br>Meaning <i>: 33 percent</i></b></p>
			<p>The underline contains one of the Deadly Five pronouns (<i>it, its, they, their, them</i>): </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) it is just over 33 percent
	(B) which uses just over 33 percent
	(C) nuclear power accounts for just over 33 percent 
	(D) just over 33 percent comes from nuclear power 
	(E) where it is just over 33 percent
			</pre>
			<p>Answers (A) and (E) use the pronoun <i>it</i>. It would be illogical for the pronoun to refer to <i>75 percent</i> or to <i>the energy produced in France</i>. What about just <i>the energy</i>? In this case, the sentence would read <i>the energy is just over 33 percent</i>. The sentence isn't clear.</p>
			<p>Logically, the sentence is trying to compare something about the energy produced in France to something about the energy produced in Germany, but the original sentence doesn't say that. Answers (A) and (E) both contain the ambiguous <i>it</i>. Answer (B) removes the pronoun <i>it</i> but still doesn't explain <i>33 percent</i> of what. Eliminate all three.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>X compared to Y</i></b></p>
			<p>When examining the initial meaning issue, you may have noticed that the remaining answer choices change the initial word <i>while</i> to various contrast words.</p>
			<p>The structure <i>X compared to Y</i> indicates a comparison. In answer (B), <i>X</i> is <i>percent of the energy</i> and <i>Y</i> is <i>Germany</i>—bad comparison! The remaining answer choices also indicate a comparison, but none repeats this faulty structure. Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>the energy</i></b></p>
			<p>This one is very hard to spot. When the article <i>the</i> is used in front of a word, it's referring to one specific example of that thing.</p>
			<p><table class="example">
			  <tr>
				<td>Arya likes the apple.</td>
				<td> → </td>
				<td>She likes one specific apple.</td>

			  <tr>
				<td>Arya likes the apple whereas Jon despises the apple.</td>
				<td> → </td>
				<td>The two are passing judgment on one particular apple.</td>
			  </tr>			  
			</table></p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) contain two instances of <i>the energy</i>; are both referring to the same energy?</p>
			<p>In the first half of the sentence, <i>the energy</i> mentioned is specifically <i>the energy produced in France</i>.  Answers (D) and (E) both refer to <i>the energy</i> in the second half of the sentence, but you don't want to talk about the French energy again. The sentence is attempting to contrast the energy produced in France with the energy produced in Germany.</p>
			<p>The second half is talking about different energy, not the same energy mentioned in the first half. Eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>

</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>

			<p><b>Pronoun: <i>someone; they</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence contains two pronouns in the underline: <i>it</i> and <i>someone</i>. Are both used correctly?</p>
			<p>The pronoun <i>it</i> refers back to <i>the term “psychopath,”</i> a logical referent. <i>It</i> also refers to the following pronoun,<i>someone</i>: <i>It is someone</i>. Can <i>the term</i> “ <i>psychopath</i>” be a person? No; the second pronoun doesn't make sense. Eliminate answer (A).</p>

		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning </b></p>
			<p>Several of the answer choices change the initial pronoun <i>someone</i> to various forms of a noun: <i>person</i> or <i>people</i>.</p>
			<p>Although answers (B) and (C) do change the pronoun to a noun ( <i>person</i> and <i>people</i>, respectively), the original problem still exists; the <i>term</i> cannot be called a <i>person</i> or <i>people</i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (C).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) does correct part of the problem by inserting the language <i>in reference to</i>, making clear that <i>the term</i> itself is not actually a <i>person</i>. This answer, however, uses the plural <i>people</i>. <i>The term “psychopath”</i> is singular and cannot refer to multiple <i>people</i> at once. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
			<p>Note: Answer (E) would also need to include some kind of main verb after <i>is</i>. For example: <i>The term“psychopath”</i> is used when referring to <i>X</i>.</p>

			<p><b>Structure / Parallelism <br>Parallelism: <i>reduced W, X, and Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence appears to offer a list of four things: <i>Studies have reduced (W) sickness, (X) sleeping, (Y) fatigue, and (Z) have raised efficiency</i>. The fourth item on the list (a verb) is not parallel to the first three (nouns). Also note that the verb leading into the list is <i>reduced</i>. How can the studies <i>reduce</i> something and <i>raise</i> it at the same time?</p>
			<p>The exact nature of the lack of parallelism reveals an important clue towards the fix: the structure of the sentence is faulty. Three things were reduced: sickness, sleeping, and fatigue. A fourth thing was raised: efficiency. The correct answer should separate this fourth thing from the other three.</p>
			<p>Answers (A), (B), and (D) all incorrectly maintain the four-item list structure; eliminate them. Answers (C) and (E) partially fix the initial structural problem by adding the word <i>and</i> before the third item in the list, but the structure of the rest of the sentence changes:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">

	(E) have reduced <span style="color: red;">(W), (X), and fatigue was lowered</span> while raising efficiency

			<p><b>Idiom: <i>apprenticeship of</i></b></p>

			</pre>
			<p>First, <i>Müller</i> himself did not <i>culminate</i> in anything; his <i>career</i> did. Eliminate answers (A) and (D).</p>
			<p>Further, in answer (D), parallelism would allow the <i>had</i> portion of <i>had begun</i> to apply to <i>culminated: had begun and (had) culminated</i>. This is illogical; the two events took place at different times in the past.</p>
			<p>Finally, if <i>Müller's career</i> has already <i>culminated</i> in something, then the beginning of that career (which must have happened earlier!) cannot be described with the present perfect <i>has begun</i>. Eliminate answer (E).</p>

			<p>In answers (B), (C), and (D), the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions of the comparison are not parallel. A sentence can compare <i>tubes</i> to <i>tubes</i> or <i>birds</i> to <i>mammals</i>, but not a type of animal to a <i>tube</i>. Eliminate (B), (C), and (D).</p>
			<p>Answer (E) is a bit tricky. It is comparing <i>tubes</i> to <i>tubes</i> (that is, it is technically parallel), but notice the difference between the placement of the <i>X</i> element and the <i>Y</i> element in the two remaining answers, (A) and (E).</p>
			<p>Answer (A) follows very strict parallelism:<i>in mammals, the tubes</i> are a certain way and <i>in birds, the tubes</i> are a certain (different) way. In answer (E), notice that <i>in mammals</i> has moved elsewhere in the sentence:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(E) unlike the tiny tubes, which in mammals are (something), in birds the tubes form (something else).
			</pre>
			<p>Whose <i>tiny tubes</i> are the subject of the first half of the comparison? Presumably, the <i>mammals</i>, but the <i>mammals</i> are only mentioned as an afterthought. The structure of answer (A) doesn't contain this ambiguity. Eliminate (E).</p>

	The sentence contains a comma just before the underline and a “comma and” structure in the underline. Watch for Parallelism, Structure, Meaning, and Modifier issues.
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>goes into decline</i></b></p>
			<p>Pay attention to meaning when reading these sentences. The original sentence contains a list of three things:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
a composer who (X) receives popular acclaim, (Y) goes into decline after death, and (Z) never regains popularity again.
			</pre>
			<p>It's illogical to say that the person himself <i>goes into decline</i> after dying. The other answers introduce the word <i>reputation</i> into the sentence; someone's <i>reputation</i> can decline after that person dies. Eliminate answer (A).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Meaning: <i>again</i></b></p>
			<p>Now that you've spotted one meaning issue, watch for others! The third item on the list says that the composer <i>never regains popularity again</i>.</p>
			<p>To <i>regain</i> means to gain something back again—the meaning of <i>again</i> is already included in the word <i>regain</i>. Answers (A), (B), and (D) all pair <i>regain</i> with the redundant <i>again</i>; eliminate them.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Structure / Parallelism </b></p>
			<p>Compare the list structure in each choice:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) composer who <span style="color: green;">receives</span> acclaim, <span style="color: green;">goes</span> into decline, and never <span style="color: green;">regains</span>  
	(B) composer <span style="color: red;">who receives</span> acclaim, <span style="color: red;">whose reputation declines</span> <span style="color: red;">and never regains </span> 
	(C) composer <span style="color: green;">who receives</span> acclaim, <span style="color: green;">but whose reputation declines</span> and never <span style="color: green;">regains</span>  
	(D) composer <span style="color: red;">who receives</span> acclaim, <span style="color: red;">who declines</span> in reputation <span style="color: red;">and who never regained  </span>
	(E) composer who <span style="color: red;">receives</span> acclaim, <span style="color: red;">then has declined</span> and never <span style="color: red;">regained</span>
			</pre>
			<p>Answer (A) is technically parallel (though the meaning is illogical). The remaining four answers share one very tiny but crucial difference from (A): there is no longer a comma before the parallel marker <i>and</i>. What does this mean?</p>
			<p>The sentence is no longer attempting to provide a list of three parallel items. Parallelism must still exist, but only the portions about <i>declining</i> and <i>regaining</i> need to be made parallel. This parallelism shift also requires a structural shift to separate what used to be the first item in the list from the two later items.</p>
			<p>For example, in answer (C), the conjunction <i>but</i> is introduced, followed by a new subject, <i>reputation</i>. Consider this example:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
<span style="color: blue;">The company gained market share, but its competitor was even more successful and took over the number one spot.</span>
			</pre>
			<p>This sentence first says something about the company and then says two things about the competitor. Likewise, in answer (C), the sentence first says something about the <i>composer</i> and then says two things about the <i>composer's reputation</i>.</p>
			<p>Answers (B) and (D) are missing the necessary conjunction (<i>but</i>, or similar) to launch its new subject, <i>reputation</i>. Eliminate answers (B) and (D).</p>
			<p>Answers (D) and (E) have verb tense problems. It is acceptable to have different verb tenses in a parallel structure as long as the meaning of the sentence dictates a different tense. It's illogical, though, to say that the reputation <i>declines</i> (present) or <i>has declined</i> (present perfect) and then say that the reputation <i>never regained popularity</i>, when this final action should take place at the same time as or later than the <i>decline</i> action. Eliminate answers (D) and (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the original Meaning errors by making clear that a composer's <i>reputation</i> declines after death and by eliminating the redundant <i>again</i>. The three verb tenses ( <i>receives, declines, regains</i>) make logical sense.

<div class="round-box">
	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Idiom: <i>such X like Y</i></b></p>
			<p>The original sentence uses <i>such like</i> to introduce some examples. Cleverly, the writers have separated the words <i>such</i> and <i>like</i> by sticking <i>mosquito-borne diseases</i> in between, making it harder to spot the full idiom.</p>
			<p>The word <i>such</i> isn't underlined, so the correct answer needs to start with <i>as</i>. Eliminate answers (A) and (B).</p>
			<p>Although uncommon in everyday speech, it is okay to separate the <i>such</i> and the <i>as</i>, but the words in between need to be the category of thing under discussion. The sentence wants to give examples of <i>mosquito-borne diseases</i>, so it's acceptable to say <i>such mosquito-borne diseases as X and Y</i>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Parallelism: <i>either X or Y</i></b></p>
			<p>In the idiom <i>either X or Y</i>, the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> portions have to be parallel:</p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	(A) focused either <span style="color: red;">on the vaccination</span>… or <span style="color: red;">on exterminating</span>
	(B) focused either <span style="color: red;">on vaccinating</span>… or <span style="color: red;">on the extermination</span>
	(C) focused on either <span style="color: red;">vaccinating</span>… or <span style="color: red;">on exterminating </span>
	(D) focused on either <span style="color: red;">vaccinating</span>… or <span style="color: red;">on extermination </span>
	(E) focused on either <span style="color: green;">vaccinating</span>… or <span style="color: green;">exterminating</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The sentence uses the idiom <i>focused on</i>. If the word <i>on</i> is part of the <i>X</i> portion, as in answer (A), then it has to be repeated as part of the <i>Y</i> portion; answers (A) and (B) do this. If the word <i>on</i> comes before <i>either</i>, however, then <i>on</i> should not be part of either the <i>X</i> or the <i>Y</i> portions. Answer (E) shows this version correctly, but answers (C) and (D) both incorrectly repeat <i>on</i> as part of the <i>Y</i> element. Eliminate answers (C) and (D).</p>
			<p>Next, the <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> elements in all five answer choices are nouns, which seems to be good. There are different kinds of nouns, though: regular nouns, such as <i>extermination</i>, and <i>-ing</i> words called gerunds, such as <i>vaccinating</i>. Gerunds can be written in one of two ways: simple (such as <i>running</i> in the sentence “Running is fun”) and complex (such as <i>the running</i> in the sentence “The running of the bulls is a tradition in Spain.”) The GMAT test writers don't like to make regular nouns parallel to simple gerunds—though it is okay to pair regular nouns and complex gerunds. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (D) for pairing regular nouns with simple gerunds.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (E) uses the proper idiom <i>such X as Y</i> to introduce examples and also corrects the parallelism error by pairing the simple gerunds <i>vaccinating</i> and <i>exterminating</i>.

	<b>Issues</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>did; had</i></b></p>
			<p>The structure <i>no X caused such a worldwide sensation as Y</i> indicates a comparison. One sighting (<i>Y</i>) caused much more excitement than all of the others (<i>X</i>).</p>
			<p>The sentence should compare the <i>other historical sightings</i> with the one sighting <i>in 1910–1911</i>. Answer (A), though, uses the word <i>did</i> to introduce the <i>Y</i> portion of the comparison.<i>Did</i> already appears elsewhere in the sentence: <i>did Halley's Comet cause</i>. Parallelism seems to dictate a comparison between the comet itself and one instance of the comet's return (in 1910–1911), but this is illogical. Answer (D) makes this same error. Finally, answer (B) also introduces the <i>Y</i> portion of the comparison with a verb (<i>had</i>); the same issue exists even though the specific verb has changed. Eliminate answers (A), (B), and (D).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Verb: <i>had</i></b></p>
			<p>Answer (B) changes the verb from <i>did</i> to <i>had</i>.</p>
			<p>Comparisons should be parallel. In this case, the non-underlined portion says <i>did cause</i> and the <i>cause</i> portion is not repeated later. The word <i>cause</i> would therefore have to be able to be repeated with <i>had</i> as well as <i>did</i>. It's incorrect to say <i>had cause</i>. (Note: The sentence shouldn't have a verb form here at all; see the comparison issue discussed above.) Eliminate answer (B).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p><b>Comparison: <i>its return</i></b></p>
			<p>After dealing with the first issue (an illogical comparison), you'll have only two answers left: </p>
			<pre class="compare-group">
	<span style="color: green;">(C) in its return of 1910–1911</span>
	<span style="color: red;">(E) its return in 1910–1911</span>
			</pre>
			<p>The <i>X</i> portion of the comparison is <i>in no other historical sighting</i>; this structure is a prepositional phrase. Ideally, then, the <i>Y</i> portion of the comparison should also be in the form of a prepositional phrase. The word <i>in</i> appears in both answers, but in different places. Logically, the <i>Y</i> portion should be the <i>return</i> of the comet, not simply the year in which it returned. The word <i>in</i> should be before <i>its return</i>. Eliminate answer (E).</p>
		</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<div class="round-box">
	<div><b>The Correct Answer</b></div>
	Correct answer (C) fixes the initial comparison error by removing the verb form that implied a comparison of Halley's Comet to a single instance of the comet's return. Further, the construction <i>in its return</i> is properly parallel to <i>in no other sighting</i>.
