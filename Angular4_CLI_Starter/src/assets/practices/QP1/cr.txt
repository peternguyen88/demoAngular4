According to the Tristate Transportation Authority, making certain improvements to the main commuter rail line would increase ridership dramatically. The authority plans to finance these improvements over the course of five years by raising automobile tolls on the two highway bridges along the route the rail line serves. Although the proposed improvements are indeed needed, the authority's plan for securing the necessary funds should be rejected because it would unfairly force drivers to absorb the entire cost of something from which they receive no benefit.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would cast the most doubt on the effectiveness of the authority's plan to finance the proposed improvements by increasing bridge tolls?
(A) Before the authority increases tolls on any of the area bridges, it is required by law to hold public hearings at which objections to the proposed increase can be raised.
(B) Whenever bridge tolls are increased, the authority must pay a private contractor to adjust the automated toll- collecting machines.
(C) Between the time a proposed toll increase is announced and the time the increase is actually put into effect, many commuters buy more tokens than usual to postpone the effects of the increase.
(D) When tolls were last increased on the two bridges in question, almost 20 percent of the regular commuter switched to a slightly longer alternative route that has since been improved.
(E) The chairman of the authority is a member of the Tristate Automobile Club that has registered strong opposition to the proposed toll increase.

(A) The fact that 90% of the people know someone who is unemployed is not an indication that unemployment is abnormally high.
(B) The current level of unemployment is not moderate.
(C) If at least 5% of workers are unemployed, the result of questioning a representative group of people cannot be the percentage Roland cites.

In Asia, where palm trees are non-native, the trees’ flowers have traditionally been pollinated by hand, which has kept palm fruit productivity unnaturally low. When weevils known to be efficient pollinators of palm flowers were introduced into Asia in 1980, palm fruit productivity increased— by up to 50 percent in some areas—but then decreased sharply in 1984.<br><br>Which of the following statements, if true, would best explain the 1984 decrease in productivity?
(A) Prices for palm fruit fell between 1980 and 1984 following the rise in production and a concurrent fall in demand.
(B) Imported trees are often more productive than native trees because the imported ones have left behind their pests and diseases in their native lands.
(C) Rapid increases in productivity tend to deplete trees of nutrients needed for the development of the fruit- producing female flowers.
(D) weevil population in Asia remained at approximately the same level between 1980 and 1984.
(E) Prior to 1980 another species of insect pollinated the Asian palm trees, but not as efficiently as the species of weevil that was introduced in 1980.

Traces of cultivated emmer wheat have been found among the earliest agricultural remains at many archaeological sites in Europe and Asia. The only place where the wild form of emmer wheat has been found growing is a relatively narrow strip of southwest Asia. Since the oldest remains of cultivated emmer wheat yet found are from village sites in the same narrow strip, it is clear that emmer wheat was first domesticated somewhere in that strip.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A) The present-day distribution of another wild wheat, einkorn, which was also domesticated early in the development of agriculture, covers a much larger area of southwest Asia.
(B) Wild emmer wheat can easily be made to yield nearly as much as modern domestic strains.
(C) At the time when emmer wheat was first cultivated, it was the most nutritious of all the varieties of grain that were then cultivated.

The recent rise of low-cost airlines in Country Y has led to great increases in the number of air travelers and flights. However, a “hidden cost” of flying and certain other forms of travel is the significant amount of air pollution, which contributes to global warming. To make people pay these hidden costs—and in the process discourage the explosive growth in flying—the government of Country Y plans to impose fees on all air travel. There is a problem, however, in that many residents of Country Y would then use automobile transportation instead, without paying the hidden costs of the resulting air pollution.<br><br>Which of the following additions to the government's plan would be likely to help most in overcoming the problem referred to in the final sentence above?

In Teruvia, the quantity of rice produced per year is currently just large enough to satisfy domestic demand. Teruvia's total rice acreage will not be expanded in the foreseeable future, nor will rice yields per acre increase appreciably. Teruvia's population, however, will be increasing significantly for years to come. Clearly, therefore, Teruvia will soon have to begin importing rice.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) No pronounced trend of decreasing per capita demand for rice is imminent in Teruvia.
(B) Not all of the acreage in Teruvia currently planted with rice is well suited to the cultivation of rice.

That claim is false, however, since according to Megaplex's own sales figures, Megaplex sold five percent more popcorn last year than in the previous year.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the theaterg0er‘s argument?
(A) When it switched from using coconut oil to using canola oil, Megaplex made sure that the chain received a great deal of publicity stressing the health benefits of the change.

In polluted environments, dolphins gradually accumulate toxins in their body fat, and the larger the dolphin the more accumulated toxins it can tolerate. Nearly 80 percent of the toxins a female dolphin has accumulated pass into the fat-rich milk her nursing calf ingests. Therefore, the unusually high mortality rate among dolphin calves in the industrially contaminated waters along Florida's Gulf Coast is probably the result of their being poisoned by their mother's milk.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A) The survival rate of firstborn dolphin calves in the area along Florida's Gulf Coast is highest for those whose mothers were killed before they were weaned.
(B) The rate at which adult dolphins living in the waters along Florida's Gulf Coast accumulate toxins is no higher than that of adult dolphins in comparably polluted waters elsewhere.
(C) Among dolphin calves born in the area along Florida's Gulf Coast, the mortality rate is highest among those with living siblings.

Perkins: According to an article I read, the woolly mammoth‘s extinction in North America coincided with a migration of humans onto the continent 12,000 years ago, and stone spearheads from this period indicate that these people were hunters. But the author's contention that being hunted by humans contributed to the woolly mammoth‘s extinction is surely wrong since, as paleontologists know, no spearheads have ever been found among the many mammoth bones that have been unearthed.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for discounting the evidence Perkins cites in arguing against the contention that being hunted by humans contributed to the North American extinction of woolly mammoths?
(A) At sites where mammoth bones dating from 12,000 years ago have been unearthed, bones of other mammals have rarely been found.
(B) The stone from which stone spearheads were made is unlikely to have disintegrated over the course of 12,000 years.
(C) Conditions in North America 12,000 years ago were such that humans could not have survived there on a diet that did not include substantial amounts of meat.
(D) Cave paintings in North America that date from 12,000 years ago depict woolly mammoths as well as a variety of other animals, including deer and buffalo.

A proposed change to federal income tax laws would eliminate deductions from taxable income for donations a taxpayer has made to charitable and educational institutions. If this change were adopted, wealthy individuals would no longer be permitted such deductions. Therefore, many charitable and educational institutions would have to reduce services, and some would have to close their doors.<br><br>The argument above assumes which of the following?
(A) Without the incentives offered by federal income tax laws, at least some wealthy individuals would not donate as much money to charitable and educational institutions as they otherwise would have.
(B) Money contributed by individuals who make their donations because of provisions in the federal tax laws provides the only source of funding for many charitable and educational institutions.
(C) The primary reason for not adopting the proposed change in the federal income tax laws cited above is to protect wealthy individuals from having to pay higher taxes.

In the late 1980s, the population of sea otters in the North Pacific Ocean began to decline. Of the two plausible explanations for the decline— increased predation by killer whales or disease—disease is the more likely. After all, a concurrent sharp decline in the populations of seals and sea lions was almost certainly caused by a pollution-related disease, which could have spread to sea otters, whereas the population of killer whales did not change noticeably.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the reasoning?
(A) Killer whales in the North Pacific usually prey on seals and sea lions but wil, when this food source is scarce, seek out other prey.
(B) There is no indication that substantial numbers of sea otters migrated to other locations from the North Pacific in the 1980s.
(C) Along the Pacific coast of North America in the 19805, sea otters were absent from many locations where they had been relatively common in former times.

This population's descendants grow to be, on average, 40 centimeters shorter than sunflowers found on the mainland. Tufe Island is significantly drier than Tufe Peninsula was. So the current average height of sunflowers is undoubtedly at least partially attributable to changes in Tufe’s environmental conditions.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) There are no types of vegetation on Tufe Island that are known to benefit from dry conditions.
(B) There were about as many sunflowers on Tufe Peninsula two centuries ago as there are on Tufe Island today.
(C) The mainland‘s environment has not changed in ways that have resulted in sunflowers on the mainland growing to be 40 centimeters taller than they did two centuries ago.

Historian: In the Drindian Empire, censuses were conducted annually to determine the population of each village. <span style="font-weight: bold">Village census records for the last half of the 16005 are remarkably complete</span>. This very completeness makes one point stand out; in five different years, villages overwhelmingly reported significant population declines. Tellingly, each of those five years immediately followed an increase in a certain Drindian tax. This tax, which was assessed on villages, was computed by the central government using the annual census figures. Obviously, <span style="font-weight: bold">whenever the tax went up, villages had an especially powerful economic incentive to minimize the number of people they recorded;</span> and concealing the size of a village's population from government census takers would have been easy. Therefore, the reported declines probably did not happen.<br><br>In the historian’s argument, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
(A) The first presents a finding to support the position the historian seeks to establish; the second is a consideration that has been used to argue against that position.
(B) The first provides a context for certain evidence that supports the position that the historian seeks to establish; the second is a judgment advanced to support that position.
(C) The first is a position that the historian seeks to establish; the second is evidence that has been used to argue against that position.
(D) The first is an assumption that the historian explicitly makes in support of a certain position; the second is that position.

In 1992 outlaw fishing boats began illegally harvesting lobsters from the territorial waters of the country of Belukia. Soon after, the annual tonnage of lobster legally harvested in Belukian waters began declining; in 1996, despite there being no reduction in the level of legal lobster fishing activity, the local catch was 9,000 tons below pre-1992 levels.  It is therefore highly likely that the outlaw fishing boats harvested about 9,000 tons of lobster illegally that year.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The illegal lobster harvesting was not so extensive that the population of catchable lobsters in Belukia’s territorial waters had sharply declined by 1996.
(B) The average annual lobster catch, in tons, of an outlaw fishing boat has increased since 1992.
(C) Outlaw fishing boats do not, as a group, harvest more lobsters than do licensed lobster-fishing boats.
(D) The annual legal lobster harvest in Belukia in 1996 was not significantly less than 9,000 tons.
(E) A significant proportion of Belukia‘s operators of licensed lobster-fishing boats went out of business between 1992 and 1996.

Printwell’s Ink Jet Division manufactures ink-jet printers and the ink cartridges they use. Sales of its ink-jet printers have increased. Monthly revenues from those sales, however, have not increased, because competition has forced Printwell to cut the prices of its printers. Unfortunately, Printwell has been unable to bring down the cost of manufacturing a printer. Thus, despite the increase in printer sales, the Ink Jet Division must be contributing less to the company's profits than it used to.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) Ink-jet printers in regular use frequently need new ink cartridges, and Printwell’s printers only accept Printwell’s ink cartridges.
(B) Unlike some competing companies, Printwell sells all of its printers through retailers, and these retailers’ costs account for a sizable proportion of the printers’ ultimate retail price.
(C) Some printer manufacturers have been forced to reduce the sale price of their ink-jet printers even more than Printwell has.
(D) In the past year, no competing manufacturer of ink-jet printers has had as great an increase as Printweil in unit sales of printers.
(E) In the past year, sales of PrintwelI's ink-jet printers have increased more than sales of any other type of printer made by Printwell.

Agricultural societies cannot exist without staple crops. Several food plants, such as kola and okra, are known to have been domesticated in western Africa, but they are all supplemental, not staple, foods. All the recorded staple crops grown in western Africa were introduced from elsewhere, beginning, at some unknown date, with rice and yams. Therefore, discovering when rice and yarns were introduced into western Africa would establish the earliest date at which agricultural societies could have arisen there.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) People in western Africa did not develop staple crops that they stopped cultivating once rice and yams were introduced.
(B) There are no plants native to western Africa that, if domesticated, could serve as staple food crops.
(C) Rice and yams were grown as staple crops by the earliest agricultural societies outside of western Africa.
(D) Kola and okra are better suited to growing conditions in western Africa than domesticated rice and yams are.
(E) Kola and okra were domesticated in western Africa before rice and yams were introduced there.

A product that represents a clear technological advance over competing products can generally command a high  price. Surprisingly, perhaps, <span style="font-weight: bold">the strategy to maximize overall profit from a new product is to charge less than the greatest price the market will bear</span>. Many companies charge the maximum possible price for such a product, because they want to make as much profit as they can and technological advances tend to be quickly surpassed. The drawback is that <span style="font-weight: bold">large profits on the new product give competitors a strong incentive to quickly match  the new product's capabilities</span>.<br><br>In the argument above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?

Nevertheless, the poll results contain an indication that expansion of the rail system, if successfully completed, might be unlikely to achieve its goal of reducing congestion, because	______________.
(A) most people in favor of expanding the rail system reported less congestion during their highway commute as the primary benefit they would experience
(B) of the less than 20 percent of residents not counted as favoring the expansion, about half claimed to have no opinion one way or the other
(C) the twice-daily periods of peak congestion caused by people commuting in cars have grown from about an hour each to almost two and a half hours each in the past 20 years

Editorial in Krenlandian Newspaper: Krenland's steelmakers are losing domestic sales because of lower-priced imports, in many cases because foreign governments subsidize their steel industries in ways that are banned by international treaties. But whatever the  cause, the cost is ultimately going to be jobs in Krenland’s steel industry. Therefore, it would protect not only steelmaking companies but also industrial employment in Krenland if our government took measures to reduce cheap steel imports.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the edit0rial’s argument?
(A) Because steel from Krenland is rarely competitive in international markets, only a very small portion of Krenlandian steelmakers' revenue comes from exports.
(B) The international treaties that some governments are violating by giving subsidies to steelmakers do not specify any penalties for such violations.
(C) For many Krenlandian manufacturers who face severe international competition in both domestic and export markets, steel constitutes a significant part of their raw material costs.
(D) Because of advances in order-taking, shipping, and inventory systems, the cost of shipping steel from foreign producers to Krenland has fallen in recent years.
(E) Wages paid to workers in the steel industry in Krenland do not differ significantly from wages paid to workers in many of the countries that export steel to Krenland.

Southington University's fund-raisers succeeded in getting donations from 80 percent of the potential donors they contacted this year. This rate would be the expected rate if the only potential donors contacted were those who have donated in the past. But good fund-raisers constantly contact less likely prospects in an effort to expand the donor base. Thus the high success rate, far from showing that the fund-raisers did a good job, shows insufficient canvassing effort.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A) Among potential donors contacted by Southington University's fund-raisers, the majority of those who did not make donations were people who had made donations to the university in the past.
(B) The amount of money raised by Southington University's fundraisers this year was lower than the amount they had raised in any of the previous several years.
(C) Individual donations made to Southington University this year were, on average, slightly larger than were average individual donations made to many other universities.

Frobisher, a sixteenth-century English explorer, had soil samples from Canada's Kodlunarn Island examined for gold content. Because high gold content was reported, Elizabeth I funded two mining expeditions. Neither expedition found any gold there. Modern analysis of the island's soil indicates a very low gold content. Thus the methods used to determine the gold content of Frobisher‘s samples must have been inaccurate.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A) The gold content of the soil on Kodlunarn Island is much lower today than it was in the sixteenth century.
(B) The two mining expeditions funded by I did not mine the same part of Kodlunarn Island.
(C) The methods used to assess gold content of the soil samples provided by Frobisher were different from those generally used in the sixteenth century.

Electric utilities pay less for low-quality coal per ton delivered than for high-quality coal. Yet more low-quality coal   than high—quality coal must be burned to generate the same amount of electricity. Moreover, per ton of coal burned, low-quality coal generates more ash than does high-quality coal, and the disposal of ash is becoming more and more expensive.<br><br>The considerations above, if true, most strongly support which of the following claims?
(A) A coal-burning utility might not be assured of benefiting economically by always adhering to the policy of keeping its overall coal purchasing costs as low as possible.
(B) In those regions where the cost of disposing of coal ash is negligible, it is more expensive for coal-burning utilities to use high-quality coal than low-quality coal.
(C) Transportation costs represent a smaller proportion of the cost per delivered ton for low-quality coal than for high-quality coal.
(D) It is no less expensive to dispose of a ton of coal ash that results from the burning of high-quality coal than it is to dispose of a ton of coal ash that results from the burning of low-quality coal.
(E) In regions where coal-ash disposal is the least expensive, reserves of low-quality coal are likely to decline at a faster rate than are reserves of high-quality coal.

The Earth's rivers constantly carry dissolved salts into its oceans.
