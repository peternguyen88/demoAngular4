Much research has been devoted to investigating what motivates consumers to try new products. Previous consumer research suggests that both the price of a new product and the way it is advertised affect consumers’ perceptions of the product’s performance risk (the possibility that the product will not function as consumers expect and/or will not provide the desired benefits). Some of this research has concluded that a relatively high price will reduce  a consumer’s perception of the performance risk associated with purchasing a particular product, while other <span style="background:yellow;"><strong>studies</span></strong> have reported that price has little or no effect on perceived performance risk. These conflicting findings may simply be due to the nature of product advertisements: a recent study indicates that the presentation of an advertised message has a marked effect on the relationship between price and perceived performance risk.<br><br>Researchers have identified consumers’ perception of the credibility of the source of an advertised message—i.e., the manufacturer—as another factor affecting perceived performance risk: one study found that the greater the source credibility, the lower the consumer’s perception of the risk of purchasing an advertised new product. However, past research suggests that the relationship between source credibility and perceived performance risk may be more complex: source credibility may interact with price in a subtle way to affect consumers’ judgments of the performance risk associated with an advertised product.
According to the passage, the studies referred to in line 12 reported which of the following about the effect of price on consumers’ perception of the performance risk associated with a new product?
(A)	Although most consumers regard price as an important factor, their perception of the performance risk associated with a new product is ultimately determined by the manufacturer’s reputation.
(B)	Price interacts with the presentation of an advertised message to affect perceived performance risk.
(C)	Price does not significantly affect consumers’ perception of the performance risk associated with a new product.
(D)	Consumers tend to regard price as more important than the manufacturer’s credibility when they are buying from that manufacturer for the first time.
(E)	Consumers are generally less concerned about a new product’s performance risk when that product is relatively expensive.

The “past research” mentioned in line 25 suggests which of the following about perceived performance risk?
(A)	The more expensive a new product is, the more likely consumers may be to credit advertised claims about that product.
(B)	The more familiar consumers are with a particular manufacturer, the more willing they may be to assume some risk in the purchase of a new product being advertised by that manufacturer.
(C)	Consumers’ perception of the performance risk associated with a new product being advertised may be influenced by an interplay between the product’s price and the manufacturer’s credibility.
(D)	Consumers may be more likely to believe that a product will function as it is advertised to do when they have bought products from a particular manufacturer before.
(E)	The price of a particular advertised product may have less impact than the manufacturer’s credibility on consumers’ assessment of the performance risk associated with that product.

Which of the following, if true, would most tend to weaken the conclusions drawn from “some of this research” (see line 8)?
(A)	In a subsequent study, consumers who were asked to evaluate new products with relatively low prices had the same perception of the products’ performance risk as did consumers who were shown the same products priced more expensively.
(B)	In a subsequent study, the quality of the advertising for the products that consumers perceived as having a lower performance risk was relatively high, while the quality of the advertising for the products that consumers perceived as having a higher performance risk was relatively poor.
(C)	In a subsequent study, the products that consumers perceived as having a lower performance risk were priced higher than the highest priced products in the previous research.
(D)	None of the consumers involved in this research had ever before bought products from the manufacturers involved in the research.
(E)	Researchers found that the higher the source credibility for a product, the more consumers were willing to pay for it.

Historians remain divided over the role of banks in facilitating economic growth in the United States in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Some scholars contend that banks played a minor role in the nation’s growing economy. Financial institutions, they argue, appeared only after the economy had begun to develop, and once organized, followed conservative lending practices, providing aid to established commercial enterprises but shunning those, such as manufacturing and transportation projects, that were more uncertain and capital-intensive (i.e., requiring greater expenditures in the form of capital than in labor).<br><br>A growing number of historians argue, in contrast, that banks were crucial in transforming the early national economy. When state legislatures began granting more bank charters in the 1790s and early 1800s, the supply of credit rose accordingly. Unlike the earliest banks, which had primarily provided short-term loans to well-connected merchants, the banks of the early nineteenth century issued credit widely. As Paul Gilje asserts, the expansion and democratization of credit in the early nineteenth century became the driving force of the American economy, as banks began furnishing large amounts of capital to transportation and industrial enterprises. The exception, such historians argue, was in the South; here, the overwhelmingly agrarian nature of the economy generated outright opposition to banks, which were seen as monopolistic institutions controlled by an elite group of planters.
The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A)	compare the economic role played by southern banks with the economic role played by banks in the rest of the United States during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
(B)	reevaluate a conventional interpretation of the role played by banks in the American economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
(C)	present different interpretations of the role played by banks in the American economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
(D)	analyze how the increasing number of banks in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries affected the American economy
(E)	examine how scholarly opinion regarding the role played by banks in the American economy during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries has changed over

The passage suggests that the scholars mentioned in line 4 would argue that the reason banks tended not to fund manufacturing and transportation projects in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries was that
(A)	these projects, being well established and well capitalized, did not need substantial long-term financing from banks
(B)	these projects entailed a level of risk that was too great for banks’ conservative lending practices
(C)	banks preferred to invest in other, more speculative projects that offered the potential for higher returns
(D)	bank managers believed that these projects would be unlikely to contribute significantly to economic growth in the new country
(E)	bank managers believed funding these projects would result in credit being extended to too many borrowers

In an effort to explain why business acquisitions often fail, scholars have begun to focus on the role of top executives of acquired companies. Acquired companies that retain their top executives tend to have more successful outcomes than those that do not. Furthermore, existing <span style="background:yellow;"><strong>research</span></strong> suggests that retaining the highest-level top executives, such as the CEO (chief executive officer) and COO (chief operating officer), is related more positively to post acquisition success than retaining lower-ranked top executives. However, this explanation, while insightful, suffers from two limitations. First, the focus on positional rank does not recognize the variation in length of service that may exist in top executive posts across companies, nor does it address which particular top executives (with respect to length of service) should be retained to achieve a successful acquisition outcome. Second, the relationship between retained top executives and acquisition outcomes offered by existing research is subject to opposing theoretical explanations related to length of service. The resource-based view (RBV) suggests that keeping acquired company top executives with longer organizational tenure would lead to more successful outcomes, as those executives have idiosyncratic and nontransferable knowledge of the acquired company that would be valuable for the effective implementation of the acquisition. The opposing position, offered by the upper echelons perspective (UEP), suggests that retaining top executives having short organizational tenure would lead to more successful outcomes, as they would have the adaptability to manage most effectively during the uncertainty of the acquisition process.<br><br>Responding to these limitations, Bergh conducted a study of executive retention and acquisition outcome that focused on the organizational tenure of retained company top executives in 104 acquisitions, followed over 5 years. Bergh considered the acquisition successful if the acquired company was retained and unsuccessful if it was divested. Bergh’s findings support the RBV position. Apparently, the benefits of long organizational tenure lead to more successful outcomes than the benefits of short organizational tenure. While longer tenured top executives may have trouble adapting to change, it appears that their perspectives and knowledge bases offer unique value after the acquisition. Although from the UEP position it seems sensible to retain less tenured executives and allow more tenured ones to leave, such a strategy appears to lower the probability of acquisition success.
According to the passage, the research mentioned in line 6 suggests which of the following about lower-ranked top executives and postacquisition success?
(A)	Given that these executives are unlikely to contribute to postacquisition success, little effort should be spent trying to retain them.
(B)	The shorter their length of service, the less likely it is that these executives will play a significant role in postacquisition success.
(C)	These executives are less important to postacquisition success than are more highly ranked top executives.
(D)	If they have long tenures, these executives may prove to be as important to postacquisition success as are more highly ranked top executives.
(E)	Postacquisition success is unlikely if these executives are retained.

During the 1980s, many economic historians studying Latin America focused on the impact of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Most of these historians argued that although the Depression began earlier in Latin America than in the United States, it was less severe in Latin America and did not significantly impede industrial growth there. The historians’ argument was grounded in national government records concerning tax revenues and exports and in government-sponsored industrial censuses, from which historians have drawn conclusions about total manufacturing output and profit levels across Latin America. However, economic statistics published by Latin American governments in the early twentieth century are neither reliable nor consistent; this is especially true of manufacturing data, which were gathered from factory owners for taxation purposes and which therefore may well be distorted. Moreover, one cannot assume a direct correlation between the output level and the profit level of a given industry as these variables often move in opposite directions. Finally, national and regional economies are composed of individual firms and industries, and relying on general, sweeping economic indicators may mask substantial variations among these different enterprises. For example, recent analyses of previously unexamined data on textile manufacturing in Brazil and Mexico suggest that the Great Depression had a more severe impact on this Latin American industry than scholars had recognized.
The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A)	compare the impact of the Great Depression on Latin America with its impact on the United States
(B)	criticize a school of economic historians for failing to analyze the Great Depression in Latin America within a global context
(C)	illustrate the risks inherent in comparing different types of economic enterprises to explain economic phenomena
(D)	call into question certain scholars’ views concerning the severity of the Great Depression in Latin America
(E)	demonstrate that the Great Depression had a more severe impact on industry in Latin America than in certain other regions

Because the framers of the United States Constitution (written in 1787) believed that protecting property rights relating to inventions would encourage the new nation’s economic growth, they gave Congress—the national legislature—a constitutional mandate to grant patents for inventions. The resulting patent system has served as a model for those in other nations. Recently, however, scholars have questioned whether the American system helped achieve the framers’ goals. These scholars have contended that from 1794 to roughly 1830, American inventors were unable to enforce property rights because judges were “antipatent” and routinely invalidated patents for arbitrary reasons. This argument is based partly on examination of court decisions in cases where patent holders (“patentees”) brought suit alleging infringement of their patent rights. In the 1820s, for instance, 75 percent of verdicts were decided against the patentee. The proportion of verdicts for the patentee began to increase in the 1830s, suggesting to these scholars that judicial attitudes toward patent rights began shifting then. <br><br>Not all patent disputes in the early nineteenth century were litigated, however, and litigated cases were not drawn randomly from the population of disputes. Therefore the rate of verdicts in favor of patentees cannot be used by itself to gauge changes in judicial attitudes or enforceability of patent rights. If early judicial decisions were prejudiced against patentees, one might expect that subsequent courts—allegedly more supportive of patent rights—would reject the former legal precedents. But pre-1830 cases have been cited as frequently as later decisions, and they continue to be cited today, suggesting that the early decisions, many of which clearly declared that patent rights were a just recompense for inventive ingenuity, provided a lasting foundation for patent law. The proportion of judicial decisions in favor of patentees began to increase during the 1830s because of a change in the underlying population of cases brought to trial. This change was partly due to an 1836 revision to the patent system: an examination procedure, still in use today, was instituted in which each application is scrutinized for its adherence to patent law. Previously, patents were automatically granted upon payment of a $30 fee.
The passage implies that which of the following was a reason that the proportion of verdicts in favor of patentees began to increase in the 1830s?
(A)	Patent applications approved after 1836 were more likely to adhere closely to patent law.
(B)	Patent laws enacted during the 1830s better defined patent rights.
(C)	Judges became less prejudiced against patentees during the 1830s.
(D)	After 1836, litigated cases became less representative of the population of patent disputes.
(E)	The proportion of patent disputes brought to trial began to increase after 1836.

Candle Corporation’s television stations are likely to have more income from advertisers than previously. This is because advertisers prefer to reach people in the 18- to 49-year-old age group and the number of people in the group watching Candle television is increasing. Furthermore, among Candle viewers, the percentage of viewers 18 to 49 years old is increasing.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument that Candle Corporation will receive more income from advertisers?
(A)	Advertisers carefully monitor the demographic characteristics of television audiences and purchase advertising time to reach the audiences they prefer to reach. 
(B)	Among people over 49 years old, fewer viewers of Candle stations buy products advertised on television than do viewers of other stations. 
(C)	There will be increasingly more advertisements on television that are directed at viewers who are over 49 years old. 
(D)	Candle stations plan to show reruns of television shows during hours when other stations run shows for the first time.

During the earliest period of industrialization in Britain, steam engines were more expensive to build and operate than either windmills or water mills, the other practicable sources of power for factories. Yet despite their significant cost disadvantages, steam-powered factories were built in large numbers well before technical improvements brought their cost down. Furthermore, they were built even in regions where geographical conditions permitted the construction of wind- and water-powered factories close to major markets.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the proliferation of steam-powered factories during the earliest period of industrialization in Britain?
(A)	In many areas of Britain, there were fewer steam-powered factories than wind- or water-powered factories in the earliest period of industrialization. 
(B)	Unlike wind- or water-powered factories, steam-powered factories were fueled with coal, which sometimes had to be transported significant distances from the mine to the site of the factory. 
(C)	It was both difficult and expensive to convert a factory from wind power or water power to steam power. 
(D)	In the early period of industrialization, many goods sold in towns and cities could not be mass-produced in factories. 
(E)	In Britain, the number of sites where a wind or water-powered factory could be built was insufficient to provide for all of the demand for factory-produced goods at the time.

Which of the following most logically completes the argument?<br><br>In a typical year, Innovair’s airplanes are involved in 35 collisions while parked on being towed in airports, with a resulting yearly cost of $1,000,000 for repairs. To reduce the frequency of ground collisions, Innovair will begin giving its ground crews additional training, at an annual cost of $500,000. Although this will cut the number of ground collisions by about half at best, the drop in repair costs can be expected to be much greater, since ______________
(A)	most ground collisions happen when ground crews are rushing to minimize the time a delayed plane spends on the ground. 
(B)	a ground collision typically occurs when there are no passengers on the airplane. 
(C)	the additional training will focus on helping ground crews avoid those kinds of ground collisions that cause the most costly damage. 
(D)	the $500,000 cost figure for the additional training of ground crews includes the wages that those crews will earn during the time spent in actual training. 
(E)	most ground collisions have been caused by the least experienced ground-crew members

The air quality board recently informed Coffee Roast, a small coffee roasting firm, of a complaint regarding the smoke from its roaster. Recently enacted air quality regulations requires machine roasting more than 10 pounds of coffee to be equipped with expensive smoke-dissipating afterburners. The firm, however, roasts only 8 pounds of coffee at a time. Nevertheless, the company has decided to purchase and install an afterburner.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the firm’s decision?
(A)	Until setting on the new air quality regulations, the board had debated whether to require afterburners for machines roasting more than 5 pounds of coffee at a time. 
(B)	Coffee roasted in a machine equipped with an afterburner has its flavor subtly altered. 
(C)	The cost to the firm of an afterburner is less than the cost of replacing its roaster with a smaller one. 
(D)	Fewer complaints are reported in areas that maintain strict rules regarding afterburners. 
(E)	The firm has reason to fear that negative publicity regarding the complaints could result in lost sales.

Many athletes inhale pure oxygen after exercise in an attempt to increase muscular re-absorption of oxygen. Measured continuously after exercise, however, the blood lactate levels of athletes who inhale pure oxygen are practically identical, on average, to those of athletes who breathe normal air. The lower the blood lactate level is, the higher the muscular re-absorption of oxygen is.<br><br>If the statements above are all true, they most strongly support which of the following conclusions?
(A)	Athletes' muscular re-absorption of oxygen is not increased when they inhale pure oxygen instead of normal air. 
(B)	High blood lactate levels cannot be reduced. 
(C)	Blood lactate levels are a poor measure of oxygen re-absorption by muscles. 
(D)	The amount of oxygen reabsorbed by an athlete’s muscles always remains constant. 
(E)	The inhaling of pure oxygen has no legitimate role in athletics.

Rainwater contains hydrogen of a heavy form called deuterium. The deuterium content of wood reflects the deuterium content of rainwater available to trees during their growth. Wood from trees that grew between 16,000 and 24,000 years ago in North America contains significantly more deuterium than wood from trees growing today. But water trapped in several North American caves that formed during that same early period contains significantly less deuterium than rainwater in North America today.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to reconcile the two findings?
(A)	There is little deuterium in the North American caves than the deuterium in the water trapped there. 
(B)	Exposure to water after a tree has died does not change the deuterium content of the wood. 
(C)	Industrialization in North America over the past 100 years has altered the deuterium content of rain. 
(D)	Trees draw on shallow groundwater from rain that falls during their growth, whereas water trapped in caves may have fallen as rainwater thousands of years before the caves formed. 
(E)	Wood with high deuterium content is no more likely to remain preserved for long periods than is wood with a low deuterium content.

Many industrialized nations are trying to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, a gas released by the burning of fossil fuels. One proposal is to replace conventional cement, which is made with calcium carbonate, by a new “eco-cement.” This new cement, made with magnesium carbonate, absorbs large amount of carbon dioxide when exposed to the atmosphere. Therefore, using eco-cement for new concrete building projects will significantly help reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A)	The cost of magnesium carbonate, currently greater than the cost of calcium carbonate, probably will fall as more magnesium carbonate is used in cement manufacture. 
(B)	Eco-cement is strengthened when absorbed carbon dioxide reacts with the cement. 
(C)	Before the development of eco-cement, magnesium-based cement was considered too susceptible to water erosion to be of practical use. 
(D)	The manufacture of eco-cement uses considerably less fossil fuel per unit of cement than the manufacture of conventional cement does. 
(E)	Most building-industry groups are unaware of the development or availability of eco-cement.

Petrochemical industry officials have said that the extreme pressure exerted on plant managers during the last five years to improve profits by cutting costs has done nothing to impair the industry’s ability to operate safely. However, environmentalists contend that the recent rash of serious oil spills and accidents at petrochemical plants is traceable to cost-cutting measures.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would provide the strongest support for the position held by industry officials?
(A)	The petrochemical industry benefits if accidents do not occur, since accidents involve risk of employee injury as well as loss of equipment and product. 
(B)	Petrochemical industry unions recently demanded that additional money be spent on safety and environment protection measures, but the unions readily abandoned those demands in exchange for job security. 
(C)	Despite major cutbacks in most other areas of operation, the petrochemical industry has devoted more of its resources to environmental and safety measures in the last five years than in the preceding five years. 
(D)	There is evidence that the most damaging of the recent oil spills would have been prevented had cost-cutting measures not been instituted. 
(E)	Both the large fines and adverse publicity generated by the most recent oil spills have prompted the petrochemical industry to increase the resources devoted to oil-spill prevention.

Since many parts suppliers have more designers with specialized experience than Autoco has, Autoco expects this shift to reduce the overall time and cost of the design of its next new car.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports Autoco’s expectation?
(A)	When suppliers provide their own designs, Autoco often needs to modify its overall design. 
(B)	In order to provide designs for Autoco, several of the parts suppliers will have to add to their existing staffs of designers. 
(C)	Parts and services provided by outside suppliers account for more than 50 percent of Autoco’s total costs. 
(D)	When suppliers built parts according to specifications provided by Autoco, the suppliers competed to win contracts.

Many employers who pay their workers the current minimum wage argue that if it is raised, unemployment will increase because they will no longer be able to afford to employ as many workers.<br><br>Which of the following, if true in Stenland, most strongly supports the claim that raising the minimum wage there will not have the effects that the employers predict?
(A)	For any position with wages below a living wage, the difficulty of finding and retaining employees adds as much to employment costs as would raising wages.
(B)	Raising the minimum wage does not also increase the amount employers have to contribute in employee benefits.
(C)	When inflation is taken into account, the proposed new minimum wage is not high as the current one was when it was introduced.
(D)	Many employees currently being paid wages at the level of the proposed new minimum wage will demand significant wage increases.

Therefore, introducing the new model is unlikely to increase the number of computers in Katrovian homes.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends?
(A)	Infotek achieved the lower price of the new model by using components of lower quality than those used by other manufacturers. 
(B)	The main reason cited by consumers in Katrovia for replacing a personal computer is the desire to have an improved model. 
(C)	Katrovians in households that already have computers are unlikely to purchase the new Infotek model as an additional computer for home use.

Since the average age of the Canatrian population is gradually rising and will continue to do so, the number of fast-food restaurants is likely to decrease.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A)	Fast-food restaurants in Canatria are getting bigger, so each one can serve more customers. 
(B)	Some older people eat at fast-food restaurants more frequently than the average young person. 
(C)	Many people who rarely eat in fast-food restaurants nevertheless eat regularly in restaurants.

Last year a chain of fast-food restaurants, whose menu had always centered on hamburger, added its first vegetarian sandwich, much lower in fat than the chain’s other offerings. Despite heavy marketing, the new sandwich accounts for a very small proportion of the chain’s sales. The sandwich’s sales would have to quadruple to cover the costs associated with including it on the menu. Since such an increase is unlikely, the chain would be more profitable if it dropped the sandwich.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
(A)	Although many of the chain’s customers have never tried the vegetarian sandwich, in a market research survey most of those who had tried it reported that they were very satisfied with it. 
(B)	Many of the people who eat at the chain’s restaurants also eat at the restaurants of competing chains and report no strong preference among the competitors. 
(C)	Among fast-food chains in general, there has been little or no growth in hamburger sales over the past several years as the range of competing offerings at other restaurants has grown. 
(D)	When even one member of group of diner’s is a vegetarian or has a preference for low-fat food, the group tends to avoid restaurants that lack vegetarian or low-fat menu options. 
(E)	An attempt by the chain to introduce a lower-fat hamburger failed several years ago, since it attracted few new customers and most of the chain’s regular customers greatly preferred the taste of the regular hamburger.
