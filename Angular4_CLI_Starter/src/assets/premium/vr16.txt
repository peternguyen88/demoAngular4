Human beings, born with a drive to explore and experiment, thrive on learning. Unfortunately, corporations are oriented predominantly toward controlling employees, not fostering their learning. Ironically, this orientation creates the very conditions that predestine employees to mediocre performances. Over time, superior performance requires superior learning, because long-term corporate survival depends on continually exploring new business and organizational opportunities that can create new sources of growth.<br><br>To survive in the future, corporations must become "learning organizations," enterprises that are constantly able to adapt and expand their capabilities. To accomplish this, corporations must change how they view employees. The<br><br>traditional view that a single charismatic leader should set the corporation's direction and make key decisions is rooted in an individualistic worldview. In an increasingly interdependent world, such a view is no longer viable. In learning organizations, thinking and acting are integrated at all job levels. Corporate leadership is shared, and leaders become designers, teachers, and stewards, roles requiring new skills: the ability to build shared vision, to reveal and challenge prevailing mental models, and to foster broader, more integrated patterns of thinking. In short, leaders in learning organizations are responsible for building organizations in which employees are continually learning new skills and expanding their capabilities to shape their future.
According to the passage, traditional corporate leaders differ from leaders in learning organizations in that former
(A)	Encourage employees to concentrate on developing a wide range of skills
(B)	Enable employees to recognize and confront dominant corporate models and to develop alternative models
(C)	Make important policy decisions alone and then require employees in the corporation to abide by those decisions
(D)	Instill confidence in employees because of their willingness to make risky decisions and accept their consequences
(E)	Are concerned with offering employees frequent advice and career guidance

A key decision required of advertising managers is whether a "hard-sell" or "soft-sell" strategy is appropriate for a specific target market. The hard-sell approach involves the use of direct, forceful claims regarding the benefits of the advertised brand over competitors' offerings. In contrast, the soft-sell approach involves the use of advertising claims that imply superiority more subtly.<br><br>One positive aspect of the hard-sell approach is its use of very simple and straightforward product claims presented claims presented as explicit conclusions, with little room for confusion regarding the advertiser's message. However, some consumers may resent being told what to believe and some may distrust the message. Resentment and distrust often lead to counterargumentation and to boomerang effects where consumers come to believe conclusions diametrically opposed to conclusions endorsed in advertising claims. By contrast, the risk of boomerang erects is greatly reduced with soft-sell approaches. One way to implement the soft-sell approach is to provide information that implies the main conclusions the advertiser wants the consumer to draw, but leave the conclusions themselves unstated. Because consumers are invited to make up their own minds, implicit conclusions reduce the risk of resentment, distrust, and counterargumentation.<br><br>Recent research on consumer memory and judgement suggests another advantage of implicit conclusions. Beliefs or conclusions that are self-generated are more accessible from memory than beliefs from conclusions provided explicitly by other individuals, and thus have a greater impact on judgment and decision making. Moreover, self-generated beliefs are often perceived as more accurate and valid than the beliefs of others, because other individuals may be perceived as less knowledgeable, or may be perceived as manipulative or deliberately misleading.<br><br>Despite these advantages, implicit conclusions may mot always be more effective than explicit conclusions. One risk is that some consumers may fail to draw their own conclusions and thus miss the point of the message. Inferential activity is likely only when consumers are motivated and able to engage in effortful cognitive processes. Another risk is that some consumers may draw conclusions other than the one intended. Even if inferential activity is likely, there is no guarantee that consumers will follow the path provided by the advertiser. Finally, a third risk is that consumers may infer the intended conclusion but question the validity of their inference.
It can be inferred from the passage that one reason an advertiser might prefer a hard-sell approach to a soft-sell approach is that
(A)	the risks of boomerang effects are minimized when the conclusions an advertiser wants the consumer to draw are themselves left unstated
(B)	counterargumentation is likely from consumers who fail to draw their own conclusions regarding an advertising claims
(C)	inferential activity is likely to occur even if consumers perceive themselves to be more knowledgeable than the individuals presenting product claims
(D)	research on consumer memory suggests that the explicit conclusions provided by an advertiser using hard-sell approach have a significant impact on decision making
(E)	the information presented by an advertiser using the soft-sell approach may imply different conclusions to different consumers

Suppose we were in a spaceship in free fall, where objects are weightless, and wanted to know a small solid object's mass. We could not simply balance that object against another of known weight, as we would on Earth. The unknown mass could be determined, however, by placing the object on a spring scale and swinging the scale in a circle at the end of a string. The scale would measure the tension in the string, which would depend on both the speed of revolution and the mass of the object. The tension would be greater, the greater the mass or the greater the speed of revolution. From the measured tension and speed of whirling, we could determine the object's mass.<br><br>Astronomers use an analogous procedure to "weigh" double-star systems. The speed with which the two stars in a double-star system circle one another depends on the gravitational force between them, which holds the system together. This attractive force, analogous to the tension in the string, is proportional to the stars' combined mass, according to Newton's law of gravitation. By observing the time required for the stars to circle each other (the period) and measuring the distance between them, we can deduce the restraining force, and hence the masses.
It can be inferred from the passage that the two procedures described in the passage have which of the following in common?

In current historiography, the picture of a consistent, unequivocal decline in women's status with the advent of capitalism and industrialization is giving way to an analysis that not only emphasizes both change (whether improvement or decline) and continuity but also accounts for geographical and occupational variation. The history of women's work in English farmhouse cheese making between 1800 and 1930 is a case in point. In her influential Women Workers and the Industrial Revolution (1930), Pinchbeck argued that the agricultural revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with its attendant specialization and enlarged scale of operation, curtailed women's participation in the business of cheese production. Earlier, she maintained, women had concerned themselves with feeding cows, rearing calves, and even selling the cheese in local markets and fairs. Pinchbeck thought that the advent of specialization meant that women's work in cheese dairying was reduced simply to processing the milk. "Dairymen" (a new social category) raised and fed cows and sold the cheese through factors, who were also men. With this narrowing of the scope of work, Pinchbeck believed, women lost business ability, independence, and initiative.<br><br>Though Pinchbeck portrayed precapitalist, preindustrial conditions as superior to what followed, recent scholarship has seriously questioned the notion of a golden age for women in precapitalist society.

The primary purpose of the passage is to
(A)	present recently discovered evidence that supports a conventional interpretation of a historical period
(B)	describe how reinterpretations of available evidence have reinvigorated a once-discredited scholarly position
(C)	explain why some historians have tended to emphasize change rather than continuity in discussing a particular period
(D)	explore how changes in a particular occupation serve to counter the prevailing view of a historical period
(E)	examine a particular area of historical research in order to exemplify a general scholarly trend

In current historiography, the picture of a consistent, unequivocal decline in women's status with the advent of capitalism and industrialization is giving way to an analysis that not only emphasizes both change (whether improvement or decline) and continuity but also accounts for geographical and occupational variation. The history of women's work in English farmhouse cheese making between 1800 and 1930 is a case in point. In her influential Women Workers and the Industrial Revolution (1930), Pinchbeck argued that the agricultural revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, with its attendant specialization and enlarged scale of operation, curtailed women's participation in the business of cheese production. Earlier, she maintained, women had concerned themselves with feeding cows, rearing calves, and even selling the cheese in local markets and fairs. Pinchbeck thought that the advent of specialization meant that women's work in cheese dairying was reduced simply to processing the milk. "Dairymen" (a new social category) raised and fed cows and sold the cheese through factors, who were also men. With this narrowing of the scope of work, Pinchbeck believed, women lost business ability, independence, and initiative.<br><br>Though Pinchbeck portrayed precapitalist, preindustrial conditions as superior to what followed, recent scholarship has seriously questioned the notion of a golden age for women in precapitalist society. For example, scholars note that women's control seldom extended to the disposal of the proceeds of their work. In the case of cheese, the rise of factors may have compromised women's ability to market cheese at fairs.

Regarding English local markets and fairs, which of the following can be inferred from the passage?
(A)	Both before and after the agricultural revolution, the sellers of agricultural products at these venues were men.
(B)	Knowing who the active sellers were at these venues may not give a reliable indication of who controlled the revenue from the sales.
(C)	There were no parallel institutions at which American cheese makers could sell their own products.
(D)	Prior to the agricultural revolution, the sellers of agricultural products at these venues were generally the producers themselves.
(E)	Prior to the agricultural revolution, women sold not only cheese but also products of arable agriculture at these venues.

Micro-wear patterns found on the teeth of long-extinct specimens of the primate species australopithecine may provide evidence about their diets. For example, on the basis of tooth micro-wear patterns, Walker dismisses Jolly's hypothesis that australopithecines ate hard seeds. He also disputes Szalay's suggestion that the heavy enamel of australopithecine teeth is an adaptation to bone crunching, since both seed cracking and bone crunching produce distinctive micro-wear characteristics on teeth. His conclusion that australopithecines were frugivores (fruit eaters) is based upon his observation that the tooth micro-wear characteristics of east African australopithecine specimens are indistinguishable from those of chimpanzees and orangutans, which are commonly assumed to be frugivorous primates.<br><br>However, research on the diets of contemporary primates suggests that micro-wear studies may have limited utility in determining the foods that are actually eaten. For example, insect eating, which can cause distinct micro-wear patterns, would not cause much tooth abrasion in modern baboons, who eat only soft-bodied insects rather than hard-bodied insects. In addition, the diets of current omnivorous primates vary considerably depending on the environments that different groups within a primate species inhabit; if australopithecines were omnivores too, we might expect to find considerable population variation in their tooth micro-wear patterns. Thus, Walker's description of possible australopithecine diets may need to be expanded to include a much more diverse diet.
According to the passage, Walker and Szalay disagree on which of the following points?
(A)	The structure and composition of australopithecine teeth
(B)	The kinds of conclusions that can be drawn from the micro-wear patterns on australopithecine teeth

(A)	Certain adhesives and drying agents used in particular types of furniture, carpets, and paint contribute the bulk of the toxic substances that circulate in the air of office buildings.
(B)	Most office buildings with sick building syndrome were built between 1950 and 1990.
(C)	Among buildings designed to prevent outside air from entering, houses are no less likely than office buildings to have air that contains elevated levels of toxic substances.

This is puzzling because a more active person generally requires a greater food intake to maintain or gain weight.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, best reconciles the apparent discrepancy described above?
(A)	Increased activity leads to increased levels of hunger, especially when food intake is not also increased.
(B)	Massage increases premature babies’ curiosity about their environment, and curiosity leads to increased activity.
(C)	Increased activity causes the intestines of premature babies to mature more quickly, enabling the babies to digest and absorb more of the nutrients in the milk they drink.
(D)	Massage does not increase the growth rate of babies over one year old, if the babies had not been previously massaged.
(E)	Premature babies require a daily intake of nutrients that is significantly higher than that required by babies who were not born prematurely.

Budget constraints have made police officials consider reassigning a considerable number of officers from traffic enforcement to work on higher-priority, serious crimes. Reducing traffic enforcement for this reason would be counterproductive, however, in light of the tendency of criminals to use cars when engaged in the commission of serious crimes. An officer stopping a car for a traffic violation can make a search that turns up evidence of serious crime.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument given?
(A)	An officer who stops a car containing evidence of the commission of a serious crime risks a violent confrontation, even if the vehicle was stopped only for a traffic violation.
(B)	When the public becomes aware that traffic enforcement has lessened, it typically becomes lax in obeying traffic rules.

Meat from chickens contaminated with salmonella bacteria can cause serious food poisoning. Capsaicin, the chemical that gives chili peppers their hot flavor, has antibacterial properties. Chickens do not have taste receptors for capsaicin and will readily eat feed laced with capsaicin. When chickens were fed such feed and then exposed to salmonella bacteria, relatively few of them became contaminated with salmonella. <br><br>In deciding whether the feed would be useful in raising salmonella-free chicken for retail sale, it would be most helpful to determine which of the following?
(A)	Whether feeding capsaicin to chickens affects the taste of their meat
(B)	Whether eating capsaicin reduces the risk of salmonella poisoning for humans
(C)	Whether chicken is more prone to salmonella contamination than other kinds of meat
(D)	Whether appropriate cooking of chicken contaminated with salmonella can always prevent food poisoning

Which of the following most logically completes the argument below? <br><br>When mercury-vapor streetlights are used in areas inhabited by insect-eating bats, the bats feed almost exclusively around the lights, because the lights attract flying insects. In Greenville, the mercury-vapor streetlights are about to be replaced with energy-saving sodium streetlights, which do not attract insects. This change is likely to result in a drop in the population of insect-eating bats in Greenville, since __________.
(A)	the bats do not begin to hunt until after sundown
(B)	the bats are unlikely to feed on insects that do not fly
(C)	the highway department will be able to replace mercury-vapor streetlights with sodium streetlights within a relatively short time and without disrupting the continuity of lighting at the locations of the streetlights
(D)	in the absence of local concentrations of the flying insects on which bats teed, the bats expend much more energy on hunting for food, requiring much larger quantities of insects to sustain each bat
(E)	bats use echolocation to catch insects and therefore gain no advantage from the fact that insects flying in the vicinity of streetlights are visible at night

Rats injected with morphine exhibit decreased activity of the immune system, the bodily system that fights off infections. These same rats exhibited heightened blood levels of corticosteroids, chemicals secreted by the adrenal glands.

On May first, in order to reduce the number of overdue books, a children’s library instituted a policy of forgiving fines and giving bookmarks to children returning all of their overdue books. On July first there were twice as many overdue books as there had been on May first, although a record number of books had been returned during the interim.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the apparent inconsistency in the results of the library’s policy?
(A)	The librarians did not keep accurate records of how many children took advantage of the grace period, and some of the children returning overdue books did not return all of their overdue books.
(B)	Although the grace period enticed some children to return all of their overdue books, it did not convince all of the children with overdue books to return all of their books.
(C)	The bookmarks became popular among the children, so in order to collect the bookmarks, many children borrowed many more books than they usually did and kept them past their due date.
(D)	The children were allowed to borrow a maximum of five books for a two-week period, and hence each child could keep a maximum of fifteen books beyond their due date within a two-month period.
(E)	Although the library forgave overdue fines during the grace period, the amount previously charged the children was minimal; hence, the forgiveness of the fines did not provide enough incentive for them to return their overdue books.

Aroca City currently funds its public schools through taxes on property. In place of this system, the city plans to introduce a sales tax of three percent on all retail sales in the city. Critics protest that <strong>three percent of current retail sales falls short of the amount raised</strong> for schools by property taxes. The critics are correct on this point. Nevertheless, implementing the plan will probably not reduce the money going to Aroca's schools. Several large retailers have selected Aroca City as the site for huge new stores, and these are certain to draw large numbers of shoppers from neighboring municipalities, where sales are taxed at rates of six percent and more. In consequence, <strong>retail sales in Aroca City are bound to increase substantially</strong>.<br><br>In the argument given, the two potions in boldface play which of the following roles?
(A)	The first is an objection that has been raised against a certain plan; the second is a prediction that, if accurate, undermines the force of that objection.

Colorless diamonds can command high prices as gemstones. A type of less valuable diamonds can be treated to remove all color. Only sophisticated tests can distinguish such treated diamonds from naturally colorless ones. However, only 2 percent of diamonds mined are of the colored type that can be successfully treated, and many of those are of insufficient quality to make the treatment worthwhile. Surely, therefore, the vast majority of colorless diamonds sold by jewelers are naturally colorless.<br><br>A serious flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that
(A)	comparisons between the price diamonds command as gemstones and their value for other uses are omitted
(B)	information about the rarity of treated diamonds is not combined with information about the rarity of naturally colorless, gemstone diamonds
(C)	the possibility that colored diamonds might be used as gemstones, even without having been treated, is ignored
(D)	the currently available method for making colorless diamonds from colored ones is treated as though it were the only possible method for doing so

Historian: Newton developed mathematical concepts and techniques that are fundamental to modern calculus. Leibniz developed closely analogous concepts and techniques. It has traditionally been thought that these discoveries were independent. Researchers have, however, recently discovered notes of Leibniz’ that discuss one of Newton’s books on mathematics. Several scholars have argued that since the book includes a presentation of Newton’s calculus concepts and techniques, and since <strong>the notes were written before Leibniz’ own development of calculus concepts and techniques</strong>, it is virtually certain that the traditional view is false. A more cautious conclusion than this is called for, however. <strong>Leibniz’ notes are limited to early sections of Newton’s book, sections that precede the ones in which Newton’s calculus concepts and techniques are presented.</strong><br><br>In the historian’s reasoning, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
(A)	The first provides evidence in support of the overall position that the historian defends; the second is evidence that has been used to support an opposing position.
(B)	The first provides evidence in support of the overall position that the historian defends; the second is that position.

For over two centuries, no one had been able to make Damascus blades—blades with a distinctive serpentine surface pattern—but a contemporary sword maker may just have rediscovered how. Using iron with trace impurities that precisely matched those present in the iron used in historic Damascus blades, this contemporary sword maker seems to have finally hit on an intricate process by which he can produce a blade indistinguishable from a true Damascus blade.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest support for the hypothesis that trace impurities in the iron are essential for the production of Damascus blades?
(A)	There are surface features of every Damascus blade—including the blades produced by the contemporary sword maker—that are unique to that blade.
(B)	The iron with which the contemporary sword maker made Damascus blades came from a source of iron that was unknown two centuries ago.
(C)	Almost all the tools used by the contemporary sword maker were updated versions of tools that were used by sword makers over two centuries ago.
(D)	Production of Damascus blades by sword makers of the past ceased abruptly after those sword makers' original source of iron became exhausted.
(E)	Although Damascus blades were renowned for maintaining a sharp edge, the blade made by the contemporary sword maker suggests that they may have maintained their edge less well than blades made using what is now the standard process for making blades.
