In 1971 researchers hoping to predict earthquakes in the short term by identifying precursory phenomena (those that occur a few days before large quakes but not otherwise) turned their attention to changes in seismic waves that had been detected prior to earthquakes. An explanation for such changes was offered by “dilatancy theory,” based on a well-known phenomenon observed in rocks in the laboratory: as stress builds, microfractures in rock close, decreasing the rock’s volume. But as stress continues to increase, the rock begins to crack and expand in volume, allowing groundwater to seep in, weakening the rock. According to this theory, such effects could lead to several precursory phenomena in the field, including a change in the velocity of seismic waves, and an increase in small, nearby tremors. <br><br>Researchers initially reported success in identifying these possible precursors, but subsequent analyses of their data proved disheartening. Seismic waves with unusual velocities were recorded before some earthquakes, but while the historical record confirms that most large earthquakes are preceded by minor tremors, these foreshocks indicate nothing about the magnitude of an impending quake and are indistinguishable from other minor tremors that occur without large earthquakes. <br><br>In the 1980s, some researchers turned their efforts from short-term to long-term prediction. Noting that earthquakes tend to occur repeatedly in certain regions, Lindh and Baker attempted to identify patterns of recurrence, or earthquake cycles, on which to base predictions. In a study of earthquake-prone sites along the San Andreas Fault, they determined that quakes occurred at intervals of approximately 22 years near one site and concluded that there was a 95 percent probability of an earthquake in that area by 1992. The earthquake did not occur within the time frame predicted, however. Evidence against the kind of regular earthquake cycles that Lindh and Baker tried to establish has come from a relatively new field, paleoseismology. Paleoseismologists have unearthed and dated geological features such as fault scarps that were caused by earthquakes thousands of years ago. They have determined that the average interval between ten earthquakes that took place at one site along the San Andreas Fault in the past two millennia was 132 years, but individual intervals ranged greatly, from 44 to 332 years.
The passage is primarily concerned with
(A)	explaining why one method of earthquake prediction has proven more practicable than an alternative method
(B)	suggesting that accurate earthquake forecasting must combine elements of long-term and short-term prediction
(C)	challenging the usefulness of dilatancy theory for explaining the occurrence of precursory phenomena
(D)	discussing the deficiency of two methods by which researchers have attempted to predict the occurrence of earthquakes
(E)	describing the development of methods for establishing patterns in the occurrence of past earthquakes

Exactly when in the early modern era Native Americans began exchanging animal furs with Europeans for European-made goods is uncertain. What is fairly certain, even though they left no written evidence of having done so, is that the first Europeans to conduct such trade during the modern period were fishing crews working the waters around Newfoundland. Archaeologists had noticed that sixteenth-century Native American sites were strewn with iron bolts and metal pins. Only later, upon reading Nicolas Denys’s 1672 account of seventeenth-century European settlements in North America, did archaeologists realize that sixteenth-century European fishing crews had dismantled and exchanged parts of their ships for furs.<br><br>By the time Europeans sailing the Atlantic coast of North America first documented the fur trade, it was apparently well underway. The first to record such trade—the captain of a Portuguese vessel sailing from Newfoundland in 1501—observed that a Native American aboard the ship wore Venetian silver earrings. Another early chronicler noted in 1524 that Native Americans living along the coast of what is now New England had become selective about European trade goods: they accepted only knives, fishhooks, and sharp metal.

The rate at which a road wears depends on various factors, including climate, amount of traffic, and the size and weight of the vehicles using it. The only land transportation to Rittland’s seaport is via a divided highway, one side carrying traffic to the seaport and one carrying traffic away from it. The side leading to the seaport has worn faster, even though each side has carried virtually the same amount of traffic, consisting mainly of large trucks.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference in the rate of wear?
(A)	The volume of traffic to and from Rittland’s seaport has increased beyond the intended capacity of the highway that serves it.
(B)	Wear on the highway that serves Rittland’s seaport is considerably greater during the cold winter months.
(C)	Wear on the side of the highway that leads to Rittland’s seaport has encouraged people to take buses to the seaport rather than driving there in their own automobiles.
(D)	A greater tonnage of goods is exported from Rittland’s seaport than is imported through it.
(E)	All of Rittland’s automobiles are imported by ship.

Which of the following most logically completes the argument?<br><br>When officials in Tannersburg released their plan to widen the city’s main roads, environmentalists protested that widened roads would attract more traffic and lead to increased air pollution. In response, city officials pointed out that today’s pollution-control devices are at their most effective in vehicles traveling at higher speeds and that widening roads would increase the average speed of traffic. However, this effect can hardly be expected to offset the effect pointed out by environmentalists, since __________.
(A)	increases in traffic volume generally produce decreases in the average speed of traffic unless roads are widened
(B)	several of the roads that are slated for widening will have to be closed temporarily while construction is underway
(C)	most of the air pollution generated by urban traffic comes from vehicles that do not have functioning pollution-control devices
(D)	the newly widened roads will not have increased traffic volume if the roads that must be used to reach them are inadequate
(E)	a vehicle traveling on a route that goes through Tannersburg will spend less time on Tannersburg’s roads once the roads are widened

Conventional wisdom suggests vaccinating elderly people first in flu season, because they are at greatest risk of dying if they contract the virus. This year’s flu virus poses particular risk to elderly people and almost none at all to younger people, particularly children. Nevertheless, health professionals are recommending vaccinating children first against the virus rather than elderly people.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, provides the strongest reason for the health professionals’ recommendation?
(A)	Children are vulnerable to dangerous infections when their immune systems are severely weakened by other diseases.
(B)	Children are particularly unconcerned with hygiene and therefore are the group most responsible for spreading the flu virus to others.
(C)	The vaccinations received last year will confer no immunity to this year’s flu virus.
(D)	Children who catch one strain of the flu virus and then recover are likely to develop immunity to at least some strains with which they have not yet come in contact.
(E)	Children are no more likely than adults to have immunity to a particular flu virus if they have never lived through a previous epidemic of the same virus.

Which of the following most logically completes the passage?<br><br>Leaf beetles damage willow trees by stripping away their leaves, but a combination of parasites and predators generally keeps populations of these beetles in check. Researchers have found that severe air pollution results in reduced predator populations. The parasites, by contrast, are not adversely affected by pollution; nevertheless, the researchers’ discovery probably does explain why leaf beetles cause particularly severe damage to Willows in areas with severe air pollution, since ________.
(A)	neither the predators nor the parasites of leaf beetles themselves attack willow trees
(B)	the parasites that attack leaf beetles actually tend to be more prevalent in areas with severe air pollution than they are elsewhere
(C)	the damage caused by leaf beetles is usually not enough to kill a willow tree outright
(D)	where air pollution is not especially severe, predators have much more impact on leaf-beetle populations than parasites do
(E)	willows often grow in areas where air pollution is especially severe

In setting environmental standards for industry and others to meet, it is inadvisable to require the best results that state-of-the-art technology can achieve. Current technology is able to detect and eliminate even extremely minute amounts of contaminants, but at a cost that is exorbitant relative to the improvement achieved. So it would be reasonable instead to set standards by taking into account all of the current and future risks involved.<br><br>The argument given concerning the reasonable way to set standards presupposes that
(A)	industry currently meets the standards that have been set by environmental authorities
(B)	there are effective ways to take into account all of the relevant risks posed by allowing different levels of contaminants
(C)	the only contaminants worth measuring are generated by industry
(D)	it is not costly to prevent large amounts of contaminants from entering the environment

Most scholars agree that King Alfred (A.D 849 - 899) personally translated a number of Latin texts into Old English. One historian contends that Alfred also personally penned his own law code, arguing that the numerous differences between the language of the law code and Alfred's translation of Latin texts are overweighted by the even more numerous similarities. Linguistic similarities, however, are what one expects in texts from the same language, the same time, and the same region. Apart from Alfred's surviving trasnlation and law code, there are only two other extant works from the same dialect and milieu, so it is risky to assume here that linguistic similarities point to common authorship.<br><br>The passage above proceeds by:
(A)	Providing examples that underscore another argument's conclusion.
(B)	questioning the plausibility of an assumption on which another argument depends.
(c) showing that a principle if generally applied would have anomalous consequences.
(D)	showing that the premises of another argument are mutually inconsistent.

The Sumpton town council recently voted to pay a prominent artist to create an abstract sculpture for the town square. Critics of this decision protested that town residents tend to dislike most abstract art, and any art in the town square should reflect their tastes. But a town council spokesperson dismissed this criticism, pointing out that other public abstract sculptures that the same sculptor has installed in other cities have been extremely popular with those cities’ local residents.<br><br>The statements above most strongly suggest that the main point of disagreement between the critics and the spokesperson is whether
(A)	it would have been reasonable to consult town residents on the decision
(B)	most Sumpton residents will find the new sculpture to their taste
(C)	abstract sculptures by the same sculptor have truly been popular in other cities

Microbiologist: A lethal strain of salmonella recently showed up in a European country, causing an outbreak of illness that killed two people and infected twenty-seven others. Investigators blame the severity of the outbreak on the overuse of antibiotics, since the salmonella bacteria tested were shown to be drug-resistant. But this is unlikely because patients in the country where the outbreak occurred cannot obtain antibiotics to treat illness without a prescription, and the country’s doctors prescribe antibiotics less readily than do doctors in any other European country.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the microbiologist’s reasoning?
(A)	Physicians in the country where the outbreak occurred have become hesitant to prescribe antibiotics since they are frequently in short supply.
(B)	People in the country where the outbreak occurred often consume foods produced from animals that eat antibiotics-laden livestock feed.
(C)	Use of antibiotics in two countries that neighbor the country where the outbreak occurred has risen over the past decade.
(D)	Drug-resistant strains of salmonella have not been found in countries in which antibiotics are not generally available.
(E)	Salmonella has been shown to spread easily along the distribution chains of certain vegetables, such as raw tomatoes.

Commemorative plaques cast from brass are a characteristic art form of the Benin culture of West Africa. Some scholars, noting that the oldest surviving plaques date to the 1400s, hypothesize that brass-casting techniques were introduced by the Portuguese, who came to Benin in 1485 A.D. But Portuguese records of that expedition mention cast-brass jewelry sent to Benin’s king from neighboring Ife. So it is unlikely that Benin’s knowledge of brass casting derived from the Portuguese.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
(A)	The Portuguese records do not indicate whether their expedition of 1485 included metalworkers.
(B)	The Portuguese had no contact with Ife until the 1500s.
