Structural unemployment—the unemployment that remains even at the peak of the economy’s upswings—is caused by an imbalance between the types and locations of available employment on the one hand and the qualifications and locations of workers on the other hand. When such an imbalance exists, both labor shortages and unemployment may occur, despite a balance between supply and demand for labor in the economy as a whole.<br><br>Because technological change is likely to displace some workers, it is a major factor in producing structural unemployment. While technological advance almost invariably results in shifts in demands for different types of workers, it does not necessarily result in unemployment. Relatively small or gradual changes in demand are likely to cause little unemployment. In the individual firm or even in the labor market as a whole, normal attrition may be sufficient to reduce the size of the work force in the affected occupations. Relatively large or rapid changes, however, can cause serious problems. Workers may lose their jobs and find themselves without the skills necessary to obtain new jobs. Whether this displacement leads to structural unemployment depends on the amount of public and private sector resources devoted to retraining and placing those workers. Workers can be encouraged to move where there are jobs, to reeducate or retrain themselves, or to retire. In addition, other factors affecting structural unemployment, such as capital movement, can be controlled.<br><br>Increased structural unemployment, should it occur, makes it difficult for the economy to achieve desired low rates of unemployment along with low rates of inflation. If there is a growing pool of workers who lack the necessary skills for the available jobs, increases in total labor demand will rapidly generate shortages of qualified workers. As the wages of those workers are bid up, labor costs, and thus prices, rise. This phenomenon may be an important factor in the rising trend, observed for the past two decades, of unemployment combined with inflation. Government policy has placed a priority on reducing inflation, but these efforts have nevertheless caused unemployment to increase.
All of the following are mentioned as ways of controlling the magnitude of structural unemployment EXCEPT
(A)	using public funds to create jobs
(B)	teaching new skills to displaced workers
(C)	allowing displaced workers to retire
(D)	controlling the movement of capital
(E)	encouraging workers to move to where jobs are available

Determining whether a given population of animals constitutes a distinct species can be difficult because no single accepted definition of the term exists. One approach, called the biological species concept, bases the definition on reproductive compatibility. According to this view, a species is a group of animals that can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring but cannot mate successfully with members of a different group. Yet this idea can be too restrictive. First, mating between groups labeled as different species (hybridization), as often occurs in the canine family, is quite common in nature. Second, sometimes the differences between two populations might not prevent them from interbreeding, even though they are dissimilar in traits unrelated to reproduction; some biologists question whether such disparate groups should be considered a single species. A third problem with the biological species concept is that investigators cannot always determine whether two groups that live in different places are capable of interbreeding.<br><br>When the biological species concept is difficult to apply, some investigators use phenotype, an organism’s observable characteristics, instead. Two groups that have evolved separately are likely to display measurable differences in many of their traits, such as skull size or width of teeth. If the distribution of measurements from one group does not overlap with those of another, the two groups might reasonably be considered distinct species.
The passage is primarily concerned with
(A)	describing the development of the biological species concept
(B)	responding to a critique of reproductive compatibility as a criterion for defining a species

Antonia Castañeda has utilized scholarship from women’s studies and Mexican-American history to examine nineteenth-century literary portrayals of Mexican women. As Castañeda notes, scholars of women’s history observe that in the United States, male novelists of the period—during which, according to these scholars, women’s traditional economic role in home-based agriculture was threatened by the transition to a factory-based industrial economy — define women solely in their domestic roles of wife and mother.

Editorial: Consumers in North America think that by drinking frozen concentrated orange juice, they are saving energy, because it takes fewer truckloads to transport it than it takes to transport an equivalent amount of not-from-concentrate juice. But they are mistaken, for the amount of energy required to concentrate the juice is far greater than the energy difference in the juices’ transport.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would provide the greatest additional support for the editorial’s conclusion?
(A)	Freezer trucks use substantially more energy per mile driven than do any other types of trucks.
(B)	Frozen juice can be stored for several years, while not-from-concentrate juice lasts a much shorter time.
(C)	Oranges grown in Brazil make up an increasing percentage of the fruit used in not-from-concentrate juice production.
(D)	A serving of not-from-concentrate juice takes up to six times more space than a serving of frozen concentrated juice.
(E)	Though frozen concentrated juice must be kept at a lower temperature, not-from-concentrate juice is far more sensitive to small temperature fluctuations.

Archaeologists working in the Andes Mountains recently excavated a buried 4,000-year-old temple containing structures that align with a stone carving on a distant hill to indicate the direction of the rising sun at the summer solstice. Alignments in the temple were also found to point toward the position, at the summer solstice, of a constellation known in Andean culture as the Fox. Since the local mythology represents the fox as teaching people how to cultivate and irrigate plants, the ancient Andeans may have built the temple as a religious representation of the fox.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument is based?
(A)	The constellation known as the Fox has the same position at the summer solstice as it did 4,000 years ago.
(B)	In the region around the temple, the summer solstice marks the time for planting.
(C)	The temple was protected from looters by dirt and debris built up over thousands of years.
(D)	Other structural alignments at the temple point to further constellations with agricultural significance.
(E)	The site containing the temple was occupied for a significant amount of time before abandonment.

A certain species of desert lizard digs tunnels in which to lay its eggs. The eggs must incubate inside the tunnel for several weeks before hatching, and they fail to hatch if they are disturbed at any time during this incubation period. Yet these lizard guard their tunnels for only a few days after laying their eggs.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most helps explain why there is no need for lizards to guard their tunnels for more than a few days?
(A)	The eggs are at risk of being disturbed only during the brief egg-laying season when many lizards are digging in a relatively small area.
(B)	The length of the incubation period varies somewhat from one tunnel to another.
(C)	Each female lizard lays from 15 to 20 eggs, only about 10 of which hatch even if the eggs are not disturbed at any time during the incubation period.
(D)	The temperature and humidity within the tunnels will not be suitable for the incubating eggs unless the tunnels are plugged with sand immediately after the eggs are laid.
(E)	The only way to disturb the eggs of this lizard species is by opening up one of the tunnels in which they are laid.

(B)	the photograph contains many streaks that astronomers can identify as caused by noncelestial objects
(C)	stars in the night sky do not appear to shift position relative to each other
(D)	the spot could have been caused by an object that emitted a flash that lasted for only a fraction of the time that the camera shutter was open

<strong>Economist</strong>: Paying extra for fair-trade coffee — coffee labeled with the Fairtrade logo — is intended to help poor farmers, because they receive a higher price for the fair-trade coffee they grow. But this practice may hurt more farmers in developing nations than it helps. By raising average prices for coffee, it encourages more coffee to be produced than consumers want to buy. This lowers prices for non-fair-trade coffee and thus lowers profits for non-fair-trade coffee farmers.<br><br>To evaluate the strength of the economist's argument, it would be the most helpful to know which of the following?

(B)	What proportion of coffee farmers in developing nations produce fair-trade coffee
(C)	Whether many coffee farmers in developing nations also derive income from other kinds of farming

(A)	Those who receive preventive care are not more likely to need urgent care than are those who do not receive preventive care
(B)	Jay intends the phrase "economic gains" to refer only to gains accruing to institutions within the health care system.
(C)	Productive members of society are more likely than others to suffer preventable illnesses.
(D) The economic contributions of those who receive preventive medical care may outweigh the economic losses caused by preventive care.
(E)	Jay is incorrect in stating that patients who receive preventive medical care are long-lived.

<strong>Urban planner</strong>: When a city loses population due to migration, property taxes in that city tend to rise. This is because there are then fewer residents paying to maintain an infrastructure that was designed to support more people. Rising property taxes, in turn, drive more residents away, compounding the problem. Since the city of Stonebridge is starting to lose population, the city government should therefore refrain from raising property taxes.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most weaken the urban planner's argument?
(A)	If Stonebridge does not raise taxes on its residents to maintain its infrastructure, the city will become much less attractive to live in as that infrastructure decays.
(B)	Stonebridge at present benefits from grants provided by the national government to help maintain certain parts of its infrastructure.
(C)	If there is a small increase in property taxes in Stonebridge and a slightly larger proportion of total revenue than at present is allocated to infrastructure maintenance, the funding will be adequate for that purpose.
(D)	Demographers project that the population of a region that includes Stonebridge will start to increase substantially within the next several years.
(E)	The property taxes in Stonebridge are significantly lower than those in many larger cities.

The use of growth-promoting antibiotics in hog farming can weaken their effectiveness in treating humans because such use can spread resistance to those antibiotics among microorganisms. But now the Smee company, one of the largest pork marketers, may stop buying pork raised on feed containing these antibiotics. Smee has 60 percent of the pork market, and farmers who sell to Smee would certainly stop using the antibiotics in order to avoid jeopardizing their sales. So if Smee makes this change, it will probably significantly slow the decline in antibiotics' effectiveness for humans.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument above?
(A)	Other major pork marketers will probably stop buying pork raised on feed containing growth-promoting antibiotics if Smee no longer buys such pork.
(B)	The decline in hog growth due to discontinuation of antibiotics can be offset by improved hygiene.
(C)	Authorities are promoting the use of antibiotics to which microorganisms have not yet developed resistance.
(D)	A phase-out of use of antibiotics for hogs in one country reduced usage by over 50 percent over five years
(E)	If Smee stops buying pork raised with antibiotics, the firm's cost will probably increase.

Typically during thunderstorms most lightning strikes carry a negative electric charge; only a few carry a positive charge. Thunderstorms with unusually high proportions of positive-charge strikes tend to occur in smoky areas near forest fires. The fact that smoke carries positively charged smoke particles into the air above a fire suggests the hypothesis that the extra positive strikes occur because of the presence of such particles in the storm clouds.<br><br>Which of the following, if discovered to be true, most seriously undermines the hypothesis?
(A)	Other kinds of rare lightning also occur with unusually high frequency in the vicinity of forest fires.
(B)	The positive-charge strikes that occur near forest fires tend to be no more powerful than positive strikes normally are.
(C)	A positive-charge strike is as likely to start a forest fire as a negative charge strike is.
(D)	Thunderstorms that occur in drifting clouds of smoke have extra positive-charge strikes weeks after the charge of the smoke particles has dissipated.
(E)	The total number of lightning strikes during a thunderstorm is usually within the normal range in the vicinity of a forest fire.

<strong>Psychologist</strong>: In a study, researchers gave 100 volunteers a psychological questionnaire designed to measure their self-esteem. The researchers then asked each volunteer to rate the strength of his or her own social skills. The volunteers with the highest levels of self-esteem consistently rated themselves as having much better social skills than did the volunteers with moderate levels. This suggests that attaining an exceptionally high level of self-esteem greatly improves one’s social skills.<br><br>The psychologist’s argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which of the following grounds?
(A)	It fails to adequately address the possibility that many of the volunteers may not have understood what the psychological questionnaire was designed to measure.
(B)	It takes for granted that the volunteers with the highest levels of self-esteem had better social skills than did the other volunteers, even before the former volunteers had attained their high levels of self-esteem.
(C)	It overlooks the possibility that people with very high levels of self-esteem may tend to have a less accurate perception of the strength of their own social skills than do people with moderate levels of self-esteem.
(D)	It relies on evidence from a group of volunteers that is too small to provide any support for any inferences regarding people in general.
(E)	It overlooks the possibility that factors other than level of self-esteem may be of much greater importance in determining the strength of one’s social skills.

<strong>Music critic</strong>: Fewer and fewer musicians are studying classical music, decreasing the likelihood that those with real aptitude for such music will be performing it. Audiences who hear these performances will not appreciate classical music’s greatness and will thus decamp to other genres. So to maintain classical music’s current meager popularity, we must encourage more young musicians to enter the field.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, most weakens the music critic’s reasoning?
(A)	Musicians who choose to study classical music do so because they believe they have an aptitude for the music.
(B)	Classical music’s current meager popularity is attributable to the profusion of other genres of music available to listeners.
(C)	Most people who appreciate classical music come to do so through old recordings rather than live performances.
(D)	It is possible to enjoy the music in a particular genre even when it is performed by musicians who are not ideally suited for that genre.
(E)	The continued popularity of a given genre of music depends in part on the audiences being able to understand why that genre attained its original popularity.
