<div  ans="B">
      Notice that since ABC is a right triangle then the question basically asks whether angle ACB is equal to angle CAB, because in this case AB would be equal to BC, thus triangle ABC would be an isosceles triangle.<br>
      (1) Angle ACB is twice as large as angle ADC. It certainly possible angle ACB to be equal to angle CAB (45 degrees) and angle ADC to be 22.5 degrees but it's also possible angle ACB NOT to be equal to angle CAB, for example if angle ACB is 60 degrees and angle ADC is 30 degrees. Not sufficient.<br>
      (2) Angle ACB is twice as large as angle CAB. Directly says that angle ACB is NOT equal to angle CAB, hence triangle ABC is NOT isosceles. Sufficient.<br>

      So, the roots are \(x=0\), \(x=3\) and \(x=-2\). But \(x\) cannot be negative as it equals to the even (4th) root of some expression (\(\sqrt{expression}\geq{0}\)), thus only two solution are valid \(x=0\) and \(x=3\).<br>

      Next, no formula is needed to solve this question: 112 like strawberry jam, 88 like apple jam, 60 people like both strawberry and apple jam.

So there are TOTAL of \(200-140=60\) people left who "do not like either strawberry or apple jam". Can ALL these 60 people like raspberry? As \(\text{Raspberry}=80 \ge 60\), then why not! So, maximum # of people who like raspberry and don't like either strawberry or apple jam is 60 (grey segment on the diagram).

      <b>Absolute value properties:</b><br>
      When \(x \le 0\) then \(|x|=-x\), or more generally when \(\text{some expression} \le 0\) then \(|\text{some expression}| = -(\text{some expression})\). For example: \(|-5|=5=-(-5)\);<br>
      When \(x \ge 0\) then \(|x|=x\), or more generally when \(\text{some expression} \ge 0\) then \(|\text{some expression}| = \text{some expression}\). For example: \(|5|=5\);<br>
      Another important property to remember: \(\sqrt{x^2}=|x|\).<br>
      <b>Back to the original question:</b><br>
      \(\sqrt{x^2 - 6x + 9} + \sqrt{2 - x} + x - 3=\sqrt{(x-3)^2}+\sqrt{2-x}+x-3=|x-3|+\sqrt{2-x}+x-3\).<br>
      Now, as the expressions under the square roots are more than or equal to zero then \(2-x \ge 0\) \(\rightarrow\) \(x \le 2\). Next: as \(x \le 2\) then \(|x-3|\) becomes \(|x-3|=-(x-3)=-x+3\).<br>
      \(|x-3|+\sqrt{2-x}+x-3=-x+3+\sqrt{2-x}+x-3=\sqrt{2-x}\).<br>

      Max will be able to save 25% of $2,000, which is $500, during the first month. He still needs to save \(5,500 - 500 = \$5,000\). Max's salary will be raised by one-fourth starting next month and will be \(2000*1.25 = \$2,500\). He will be able to save \(2500*0.25 = \$625\) every month starting from the second month and will save $5,000 more in 8 months (\(625*8=5000\)). Therefore it will take Max 9 months to save $5,500.<br>

      <b>THEORY</b><br>
      If exponentiation is indicated by stacked symbols, the rule is to work from the top down, thus:<br>
      \(a^{m^n}=a^{(m^n)}\) and not \((a^m)^n\), which on the other hand equals to \(a^{mn}\).<br>
      So:<br>
      \((a^m)^n=a^{mn}\);<br>
      \(a^{m^n}=a^{(m^n)}\) and not \((a^m)^n\).<br>
      <b>BACK TO THE QUESTION</b><br>
      According to the above: \(3^{3^3}=3^{(3^3)}=3^{27}\)<br>
      Next, the units digit of 3 in positive integer power repeats in pattern of 4: {3, 9, 7, 1}. So, the units digit of \(3^{27}\)  (27=<b>4</b>*6+<b>3</b>) is the same as the units digit of \(3^3\), which is 7.<br>

      Notice that since events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent, then the probability that both occur, equals to the product of their individual probability, so \(P(A \text { and } B)=P(A)*P(B)\). Also notice that \(0 \le P(A) \le 1\) and \(0 \le P(B) \le1\).<br>
      <p>(1) Probability that \(A\) will happen is 0.25. Now, since \(P(A)=0.25\), then \(P(A \text { and } B)=P(A)*P(B) \le 0.25 \lt 0.3\). Sufficient.
Or consider the following: how can the probability that both Event \(A\) and Event \(B\) will happen be more than individual probability of each happening? So, the probability that both happen cannot be more than 0.25.</p>
      (2) Probability that B will NOT happen is 0.71. The same here: since \(P(B)=1-0.71=0.29\), then \(P(A \text { and } B)=P(A)*P(B) \le 0.29 \lt 0.3\). Sufficient.<br>

#DS#31#B#
<div  ans="B">
      Statement 1: \(xy = 6\) is not sufficient to answer the question because solving the equation gives \(y = 3\) when \(x\) is 2 and \(y\) is -10 when \(x\) is \(-\frac{3}{5}\).<br>
      \(5x = y + 7\) <br>
      \(x = \frac{y + 7}{5}\) ................i<br>
      \(xy = 6\) ........................ ii<br>
      Replacing the value of \(x\) on eq ii: \(\frac{y(y + 7)}{5} = 6\)<br>
      \(y^2 + 7y = 30\)<br>
      \(y^2 + 10y - 3y - 30= 0\)<br>
      \(y (y + 10) - 3 (y + 10) = 0\)<br>
      \((y + 10) (y - 3) = 0\)<br>
      \(y = - 10\) or \(3\)<br>
      If \(y = - 10\), \(x = -\frac{3}{5}\). In this case, \(x - y = -\frac{3}{5} - (-10) = \frac{47}{5}\). Yes.<br>
      If \(y = 3\), \(x = 2\). In this case, \(x - y = 2 - 3 = -1\). No.<br>
      In each case \((x-y) \gt 0\) and \(\lt 0\). Hence statement 1 is not sufficient.<br>
      <b>Statement 2:</b> If \(x\) and \(y\) are consecutive integers, \(x = 2\) and \(y = 3\).<br>
      When \(x\) and \(y\) are consecutive integers, either \(x = y+1\) or \(y = x+1\) is possible.<br>
      <u>(i) If \(x = y+1\)</u><br>
      \(5x = y + 7\)<br>
      \(5(y+1) = y + 7\)
      \(4y = 2\)<br>
      \(y = \frac{1}{2}\). Then \(x = \frac{3}{2}\). However this is not possible because \(x\) and \(y\) are even not integers. So this option is not valid.<br>
      <u>(ii) If \(y = x+1\)</u><br>
      \(5x = y + 7\)<br>
      \(5x = x + 1 + 7\)<br>
      \(4x = 8\)<br>
      \(x = 2\)<br>
      Then, \(y = 3\). This is valid because \(x\) and \(y\) are consecutive integers.<br>
      So \((x-y) = 2-3 = -1\). Hence statement 2 is sufficient.<br>
