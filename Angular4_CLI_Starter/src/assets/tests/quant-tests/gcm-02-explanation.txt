      If \(x\) is greater than or equal to 4, equation \(|x - 4| = x\) turns into \(x - 4 = x\). The last one has no solutions. If \(x\) is less than 4, equation \(|x - 4| = x\) turns into \(4 - x = x\) or \(x = 2\).<br>

      Statement (1) by itself is insufficient.  If \(x\) is much larger than \(y\), the new price is higher than the original. But if \(x\) is only marginally larger, the new price is lower. For example, if \(x = 20\) and \(y = 19\), the new price is \(P*1.2*0.81 \lt P\).<br>
      Statement (2) by itself is insufficient.  Use the same reasoning. If \(y\) is large, the new price is small (if \(y = 100\), the new price is 0). If \(y\) is small, the new price is higher than the original (if \(y = 10\), the new price is \(P*1.12*0.9 = P*1.008 \gt P\)).<br>

      Notice that we are asked to find which of the options MUST be true, not COULD be true.<br>
      Let's see what ranges does \(\frac{x}{|x|} \lt x\) give for \(x\). Two cases:<br>
      If \(x \lt 0\) then \(|x|=-x\), hence in this case we would have: \(\frac{x}{-x} \lt x\), which is the same as \(-1 \lt x\). But remember that we consider the range \(x \lt 0\), so \(-1 \lt x \lt 0\);<br>
      If \(x \gt 0\) then \(|x|=x\), hence in this case we would have: \(\frac{x}{x} \lt x\), which is the same as \(1 \lt x\).<br>

      Given that the sequence of numbers \(a_1\), \(a_2\), \(a_3\), ... have the following properties: \(i*a_i=j*a_j\) and \(a_1=\text{positive integer}\), so \(1*a_1=2*a_2=3*a_3=4*a_4=5*a_5=...=\text{positive integer}\).<br>
      We should determine whether the options given below can occur (notice that the question is which of the following <b>COULD be true, not MUST be true</b>).<br>
      I.  \(2a_{100}=a_{99}+a_{98}\). Since \(100a_{100}=99a_{99}=98a_{98}\), then \(2a_{100}=\frac{100}{99}a_{100}+\frac{100}{98}a_{100}\). Reduce by \(a_{100}\): \(2=\frac{100}{99}+\frac{100}{98}\) which is not true. Hence this option <b>could NOT be true</b>.<br>
      II. \(a_1\) is the only integer in the sequence.

Hence this option <b>could be true</b>.<br>
      III. The sequence does not contain negative numbers. Since given that \(a_1=\text{positive integer}=n*a_n\), then \(a_n=\frac{\text{positive integer}}{n}=\text{positive number}\), hence this option is <b>always true</b>.<br>

#PS#7#D#
<div  ans="D">
      Many approaches are possible. For example:<br>
      <b>Approach #1:</b><br>
      Consider numbers from 0 to 999 written as follows:<br>
      1. 000<br>
      2. 001<br>
      3. 002<br>
      4. 003<br>
      ...<br>
      1000. 999<br>
      We have 1000 numbers. We used 3 digits per number, hence used total of \(3*1000=3000\) digits. Now, why should ANY digit have preferences over another? We used each of 10 digits equal # of times, thus we used each digit (including 7) \(\frac{3000}{10}=300\) times.<br>
      <b>Approach #2:</b><br>
      There are several ways to count the number of times 7 appears between 7 and 997. One way is to consider the number of 7's in single, double, and triple digit numbers separately.<br>
      One-digit numbers: 7 is the only one-digit number.<br>
      Two-digit numbers: 7 could be the tens digit or the units digit. Case 1: 7 is the tens digit. There are 10 ways to place 7 as the tens digit of a two-digit number. Case 2: There are 9 ways to place the units digit. Thus, for two-digit numbers we have: \(10+9=19\) numbers that contain a 7.<br>
      Three-digit numbers: Use the knowledge from the previous two scenarios: each hundred numbers will contain one 7 in numbers such as 107 or 507 and also 19 other sevens in numbers such as 271 or 237. Thus a total of 20 sevens per each hundred and 200 sevens for 1000. Since we have 700's within the range, that adds another 100 times that a seven will be written for a total of 300 times.<br>
      <b>Approach #3:</b><br>
      In the range 0-100:<br>
      7 as units digit - 10 times (7, 17, 27, ..., 97);<br>
      7 as tens digit - 10 time (71, 72, 73, ..., 79);<br>
      So in first one hundred numbers 7 is written \(10+10=20\) times.<br>
      In 10 hundreds 7 as units or tens digit will be written \(10*20=200\) times. Plus 100 times when 7 is written as hundreds digit (700, 701, 702, ..., 799).<br>
      Total \(200+100=300\).<br>

      The difference between 324,700 and 458,600 is \(458,600-324,700=133,900\) - one number per each hundred gives \(\frac{133,900}{100}=1,339\) numbers.<br>

      (1) 20% of all chips in the basket are green. Therefore 80% of all chips in the basket are red, which means that the ratio of the number of red chips to the number of green chips is 4:1 (80:20). Now, if there are total of 5 chips in the basket (4 red + 1 green) then the probability that both chips will be green will be 0 (since there are NOT two chips in a basket) but if there are  total of 10 chips in the basket (8 red + 2 green) then the probability that both chips will be green will be more than 0. Not sufficient.<br>
      (2) The ratio of the number of red chips to the number of green chips is 4:1. The same info as above. Not sufficient.<br>
      (1)+(2) Both statements tell the same thing, so we have no new info. Not sufficient.<br>

      Mac can finish the job in \(M\) days: the rate of Mac is \(\frac{1}{M}\) job/day;<br>
      Jack can finish the job in \(J\) days: the rate of Jack is \(\frac{1}{J}\) job/day;<br>
      After working together for \(T\) days, Mac left and Jack alone worked to complete the remaining work in \(R\) days, hence Mac worked for \(T\) days only and did \(\frac{T}{M}\) part of the job while Jack worked for \(T+R\) days and did \(\frac{T+R}{J}\) part of the job;<br>
      Since Mac and Jack completed an equal amount of work (so half of the job each) then \(\frac{T}{M}=\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\frac{T+R}{J}=\frac{1}{2}\). So, \(T=\frac{M}{2}\) and \(T=\frac{J}{2}-R\), therefore \(\frac{M}{2}=\frac{J}{2}-R\), which gives \(J=M+2R\).<br>
      (1) \(M = 20\) days. Not sufficient, we still need the value of \(R\).<br>
      (2) \(R = 10\) days. Not sufficient, we still need the value of \(M\).<br>
      (1)+(2) \(J=M+2R=20+2*10=40\). Sufficient.<br>

<div  ans="B">
      We are dealing with a repeating decimal in this question. It's helpful to know that there's a way to write these kinds of decimals as a fraction. For example, the repeating decimal 0.444444444(4) may be written as \(\frac{4}{9}\). So, \(\frac{5}{9}\), \(\frac{7}{9}\) and \(\frac{8}{9}\) will all be repeating decimals. You might check it in your calculator. In order to make two decimal points repeat, you have to divide the two digit number by 99. For example, \(\frac{23}{99} = 0.232323232323(23)\). Similarly, \(\frac{36}{99} = \frac{4}{11} = 0.36363636(36)\). Now it's clear that the minimum value of \(m = 4\).<br>
      <p>
        <b>Alternate Solution:</b>
      </p>
      In case you did not know the formula for the repeating decimal (most probably did not), there is another approach to solving this question - backsolving. This is not a typical backsolving question, however, since both of the variables are unknown and we have to make some assumptions to get to the solution.<br>
      1. Looking at the repeating decimal - 0.36.... - the ratio between m and n has to be slightly less than 1:3.<br>
      2. Let's run through the answer choices: <br>
      A. 3 - the number that's slightly less than 3*3 is 8. \(\frac{3}{8} = 0.375\). Does not work.<br>
      B. 4 - the number that's slightly less than 3*4 is 11. \(\frac{4}{11} = 0.3636\). Works!<br>
      C. 7<br>
      D. 13<br>
      E. 22<br>
      We could continue going through answer choices C, D, and E, but the question asks us for the smallest possible value of m, and 4 is the smallest of the ones that work (even if multiple do) so there is no value to check others.<br>

      Follow a basic approach: \(Work=Rate*Time\)<br>
      \(Q\) is a rate of a qualified worker.<br>
       \(\frac{3}{4}*Q\) - that of an apprentice.<br>
       \(\frac{1}{5}*Q\) - that of a trainee.<br>
      When people work together, their rates are added. The work is the same, which leads to:<br>
      \(W  = 5Q=(Q+2*(\frac{3}{4}*Q)+2*(\frac{1}{5}*Q))*T\).<br>
      \(5 = \frac{29}{10}*T\).<br>
      So, \(T=\frac{50}{29}\) or approximately 1 hour 44 minutes.<br>
