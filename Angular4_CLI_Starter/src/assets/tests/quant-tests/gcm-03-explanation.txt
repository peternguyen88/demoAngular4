We have that some even number is divisible by prime number \(p\), not sufficient to say whether \(p=2\), for example if \(xy=6\) then \(p\) can be either 2 or 3.<br>

      (1)+(2) If \(y=6\) then \(xy=\text{even}\), so the first statement is satisfied irrespective of the value of \(x\) and thus we have no constraints on its value.

      Step 1: Simplify. The captain and the cook together have 2 heads and 3 legs; therefore, all cats and all sailors together have 13 heads and 38 legs.<br>
      Step 2: Express the remaining information in mathematical equations, where \(S\) is the number of sailors and \(C\) is the number of cats. Multiply \(S\) and \(C\) by the number of legs each has, and set the equation equal to the remaining number of legs.  The second equation represents the number of remaining heads:<br>
      <s>
        $$4C + 2S = 38$$
        $$C + S = 13$$

      Solve the second equation for \(S\), plug the answer into the first equation, and solve for \(C\).<br>
      <d>
        $$4C + 2(13-C) = 38$$
        $$2C = 38 - 26 = 12$$
        $$C = 6$$
      </d>
      Therefore, the ship has 6 cats on board.<br>
      Another approach is to backsolve.  For example, if you choose Answer (B): 5 cats would mean 5 heads and 20 legs, add 2 heads and 3 legs for the captain and the cook, and the remaining 8 heads belong to the sailors who would then have 18 legs, because \(41 - (20 + 3) = 18\). 18 legs for 8 sailors would mean that each sailor has 2.25 legs, which is not reasonable.

Next, the length of the leg on the green line segment will be \(5-x\) and the length of the leg on the blue line segment will by \(y-1\).

      The buses travel at the same constant speed. It would take one bus to travel 4 hours to cover the distance between the cities \(M\) and \(N\) (two buses drove for 2 hours each). We need to find the speed of the bus. If the first bus was delayed by 24 minutes and the second one left 36 minutes earlier, it makes the second bus \(24+36=60\) minutes ahead of the first bus.<br>
      The meeting point was 24 miles away on this second day. We know the distance difference between the two meeting points, but we also need to find difference in time those 24 miles were covered. If the second bus drove for 1 hour before the first one departed, each of them had to go for another 1.5 hour to meet (1.5 hour + 1.5 hour + 1 hour). The second bus traveled for 2.5 hours and the first one for 1.5 hour. Therefore the meeting point on the second day was 30 minutes away from that of the previous day.<br>
      So the second bus covered 24 miles in 30 minutes, which gives us the speed of the bus, 48 mph. We can calculate the distance as we already know the speed:<br>
      \(4*48=192\) miles.<br>
      <p>
        <b>Alternative Explanation</b>
      </p>
      Say the distance between the cities is \(d\) miles.<br>
      Since both buses travel at the same constant speed and leave the cities at the same time then they meet at the halfway, so the first meeting point \(P\), is \(\frac{d}{2}\) miles away from \(M\) (and \(N\)).<br>
      Next, since the buses meet in 2 hours then the total time to cover \(d\) miles for each bus is 4 hours.<br>
      Now, on the second day one bus traveled alone for 1 hour (36min +24min), hence covered \(0.25d\) miles, and \(0.75d\) miles is left to cover.<br>
      The buses meet again at the halfway of \(0.75d\), which is 24 miles from \(\frac{d}{2}\):<br>
      Hence, \(\frac{d}{2}-24=\frac{0.75d}{2}\), which gives \(d=192\) miles.<br>

      Find the best common base for these expressions. <br>
      B is \(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{16}\), which gives us \(\frac{7}{16}\). <br>
      C is \(\frac{300}{650}\) or \(\frac{30}{65}\) or \(\frac{6}{13}\).<br>
      D is \(\frac{9}{19}\).<br>
      E is slightly greater than 0.4, not much more to surpass A, so we can eliminate it.<br>
      Now, let's see which of B, C, and D is the greatest. We can drop B as it does not add up to C or D - it is further away from \(\frac{1}{2}\) than C or D.<br>
      These two fractions are very close to \(\frac{1}{2}\). If we decrease the values of the denominators of each of the fraction by 1, we'll see that they equal \(\frac{1}{2}\). For these two fractions \(\frac{6}{13}\) and \(\frac{9}{19}\), the greater the value of denominator, the closer will the fraction be to \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(\frac{9}{19}\) is greater. This fraction property can be vividly described by two fractions \(\frac{1}{2+1}=\frac{1}{3}\) and \(\frac{50}{100+1}=\frac{50}{101}\), clearly the second one is greater.<br>
      Now, we just need to compare it to A. \(\frac{9}{19} = 0.47...\). <br>

<div  ans="A">
      (1) On that Saturday, the median number of flight arrivals every hour was 17. The median of a set with even number (24) of terms is the average of two middle terms when arranged in ascending/descending. So, the median of 17 means that 17 is the average of 12th and 13th greatest numbers of arrivals. Hence, at least 12 hours of arrivals (from 13th greatest to 24th greatest) had at least 17 flights, which means that the total number of arrivals on Saturday was at least \(12*17=204 \gt 180\). Sufficient.<br>
      (2) On that Saturday, the highest number of flight arrivals in an hour was 30. Clearly insufficient: if each hour had 30 arrivals then the total number of arrivals on Saturday would be \(24*30 \gt 180\), but if 23 hours had 1 arrival and one hour had 30 arrivals then the total number of arrivals on Saturday would be \(23*1+30 \lt 180\).

      (1) Reciprocal of the median is a prime number. If all the terms equal 1/2, then the median=1/2 and the answer is NO but if all the terms equal 1/7, then the median=1/7 and the answer is YES. Not sufficient.<br>
      (2) The product of any two terms of the list is a terminating decimal. This statement implies that the list must consists of 1/2 or/and 1/5. Thus the median could be 1/2, 1/5 or (1/5+1/2)/2=7/20. None of the possible values is less than 1/5. Sufficient.<br>

We are told that \((x+y)*20=c\), where \(x\) is the rate of pump X in gallons per minute, \(y\) is the rate of pump Y in gallons per minute and \(c\) is the capacity of the pool in gallons.<br>
The question asks to find the value of \(y\).<br>
(1) The capacity of the pool is 900 gallons. \(c=900\), hence we have that \((x+y)*20=900\), so \(x+y=45\). Not sufficient.<br>
(2) The rate of Pump X is 30 gallons per minute. \(x=30\), hence we have that \((30+y)*20=c\). We have two unknowns and only one equation. Not sufficient. <i>Consider this if \(c=1,000\), then \(y=20\) but if \(c=900\), then \(y=15\).</i><br>

      To get the least value of \(x^2*y\), which obviously will be negative, try to maximize absolute value of \(x^2*y\), as the more is the absolute value of a negative number, the "more" negative it is (the smaller it is).<br>
      To maximize \(|x^2*y|\) pick largest absolute values possible for \(x\) and \(y\): \((-\frac{1}{3})^2*(-\frac{1}{2})=-\frac{1}{18}\). Notice that: \(-\frac{1}{18} \lt -\frac{1}{36} \lt -\frac{1}{50} \lt -\frac{1}{100}\), so \(-\frac{1}{100}\) is the largest number and \(-\frac{1}{18}\) is the smallest number (we cannot obtain \(-\frac{1}{6}\) from \(x^2*y\) or else it would be the correct answer).<br>
