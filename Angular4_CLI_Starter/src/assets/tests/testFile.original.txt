#Q#The U.S. census is not perfect: thousands of Americans probably go uncounted. However, the basic statistical portrait of the nation painted by the census is accurate. Certainly some of the poor go uncounted, particularly the homeless; but some of the rich go uncounted as well, because they are often abroad or traveling between one residence and another.<br><br>Which of the following is an assumption on which the argument above depends?
#O#(A) Both the rich and the poor have personal and economic reasons to avoid being counted by the census.
#O#(B) All Americans may reasonably be classified as either poor or rich.
#O#(C) The percentage of poor Americans uncounted by the census is close to the percentage of rich Americans uncounted.

#Q#Companies considering new cost-cutting manufacturing processes often compare the projected results of making the investment against the alternative of not making the investment with costs, selling prices, and share of market remaining constant.<br><br>Which of the following, assuming that each is a realistic possibility, constitutes the most serious disadvantage for companies of using the method above for evaluating the financial benefit of new manufacturing processes?
#O#(A) The costs of materials required by the new process might not be known with certainty.
#O#(B) In several years interest rates might go down, reducing the interest costs of borrowing money to pay for the investment.
#O#(C) Some cost-cutting processes might require such expensive investments that there would be no net gain for many years, until the investment was paid for by savings in the manufacturing process.
#O#(D) Competitors that do invest in a new process might reduce their selling prices and thus take market share away from companies that do not.

#Q#In a monogamous culture, 100% of the adults are married. The average number of children per family is five and over-population is a threat.

#Q#For the writers who first gave feudalism its name, the existence of feudalism presupposed the existence of a noble class. Yet there cannot be a noble class, properly speaking, unless both the titles that indicate superior, noble status and the inheritance of such titles are sanctioned by law. Although feudalism existed in Europe as early as the eighth century, it was not until the twelfth century, when many feudal institutions were in decline, that the hereditary transfer of legally recognized titles of nobility first appeared.<br><br>The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following claims?
#O#(A) To say that feudalism by definition requires the existence of a nobility is to employ a definition that distorts history.
#O#(B) Prior to the twelfth century, the institution of European feudalism functioned without the presence of a dominant class.
#O#(C) The fact that a societal group has a distinct legal status is not in itself sufficient to allow that group to be properly considered a social class.
#O#(D) The decline of feudalism in Europe was the only cause of the rise of a European nobility.
#O#(E) The prior existence of feudal institutions is a prerequisite for the emergence of a nobility, as defined in the strictest sense of the term.

#Q#In response to years of increasing congestion at airport X, the government decided to redistribute landing slots. Henceforth, all international flights arriving from continent A would be rerouted to nearby airport Y, all flights arriving from continent B would continue to land at airport X. Several airlines opposed this measure on the grounds that it would result in lost business.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, justifies the airline's conclusion?
#O#A. The airlines' customers prefer less congested airports.
#O#B. It takes five minutes more flying time to reach the second airport.
#O#C. There are fewer runways, and thus less capacity, at airport Y.
#O#D. Airport Y is located in a region with better transport links to the final destinations of many travelers from continent B.
#O#E. Many customers traveling between continent A and continent B choose certain airlines because of the easy flight connections they offer at airport X.

#Q#In a monogamous culture, 100% of the adults are married. The average number of children per family is five and over-population is a threat. Programs to encourage birth-control have been ineffective. It has been suggested that this failure is due to these programs ignoring a tradition that values male children very highly, so that every parent wants to have at least one son. It is proposed that couples be encouraged to use birth-control measures after the birth of their first son.<br><br>If this proposal is widely accepted in the culture, we may expect that:
#O#(A) the rate of population increase will be slowed, and future generations will contain a disproportionately high number of females.
#O#(B) the rate of population increase will be slowed, and the gender balance in future generations will remain as it is at present.
#O#(C) the rate of population growth will remain the same, and future generations will contain a disproportionately high number of females.
#O#(D) there will be no significant effect either on population growth or on gender balance.
#O#(E) the population will decline precipitously, because approximately half of all families will have only a single child.

#Q#Since pollution-causing human activities can cause an increase in average global temperatures, the mild winters in the area could be a result of the high concentration of vehicle exhaust emitted in the region. However, some scientists argue that the mild winters are a result of the increased rate of conversion of commercial areas to industrial areas.<br><br>Which of the following, if true, strengthens the scientists' argument?
#O#A. Although commercial property areas tend to emit significantly less pollution than industrial areas, they still emit more than the vehicles in the area on a given day.
#O#B. Most of the people who work in commercial areas drive to work each day.

#Q# Which of the following is an accurate summary of the passage?
#O#(A) This passage examines the science of human behavior using the example of a study performed in Marion County, Indiana about traffic accidents. It suggests that certain human behaviors can have adverse effects on traffic conditions and even cause major traffic accidents. The results of the study are discussed, and suggestions for reducing aggression are presented.
#O#(B) This passage explores the relationship between location and aggressive driving. The drivers who participated in a study in Indiana were more likely to get into traffic accidents because of certain features of the area, such as residential developments and increased traffic volume. The passage then introduces the finding that aggressive driving does not cause nearly as many traffic accidents in Tucson, Arizona.
#O#(C) The passage presents the results of two studies on aggressive driving behavior. Although each study observed that the number of auto crashes increased, the proportion of crashes caused by aggressive driving rose in one study and declined in the other. Inherent differences in the locations of the two studies are discussed, and the author suggests that these differences affect the studies' results.
#O#(D) The passage attempts to defend the unpopular theory that aggressive driving is the leading cause of accidents in America. Evidence linking aggressive driving to fatal car accidents is given, and two strategies are proposed to counteract the effects of aggression: providing counseling for drivers and creating "special enforcement zones" where police can stop aggressive drivers.
#O#(E) The passage theorizes that PCFs (Primary Collision Factors) have a major effect on traffic accidents, increasing their number by a large percentage each year in some places. One supporting example of this phenomenon is then explored: the results of a study that links a variety of variables, including location, traffic volume, and the creation of "special enforcement zones," to an increase in the number of traffic accidents.
